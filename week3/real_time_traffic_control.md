#### Week 3: Introduction

If your train was the only one, life would be so much simpler. It could leave at the desired time and take you directly to your preferred destination. There would only have to be one track, one platform, no switches and (most likely) no delay. But, when millions start using the railway network, it becomes rather complex. Passengers expect to be able to travel at any time to any place, and unfortunately, both trains and the infrastructure have limited capacity.

We have local trains, intercity trains, high speed trains and freight trains, whose networks are all connected. Strategic and robust timetabling is essential to ensure comfort, reliability and safety. But that is only one piece of the operations-puzzle: if something unforeseen happens, people have to be able to adjust at the moment, in order to keep the inconvenience to a minimum. The challenge is not to make the perfect timetable on paper, but the one that is adaptable to the unexpected challenges that can happen at any moment: real-time traffic control.

Trains, timetabling and time zones
Back in the 1840s, trains started to become a more common way of transportation in the United Kingdom, after the first passenger railway network was developed. Before the railways were built, communities across the UK set their clocks according to their own local time. Bristol, for example, was 10 minutes behind Greenwich Mean Time. This was fine for as long as the pace of life was governed by the natural speed of humans and horses, but the advent of a fast, structured form of transport through the railways, meant that a standardized system of time became imperative.

Various parts of the country working on slightly different, locally-agreed time posed a safety risk - not to mention, the difficulty in constructing understandable timetables. The Great Western Railway had already adopted standardized time, but it was the Railway Clearing House – a body set up to apportion financial receipts among the many private railway companies – that set the pace elsewhere. It decreed in 1847 that all railway companies should operate using GMT, and by 1855, the vast majority of towns and cities had complied. Clocks were set to a signal, set to GMT, which was sent along the newly-installed telegraph system.

#### Market vs Concession

While our focus during this MOOC is primarily on passenger transportation, we will sometimes look at freight transport, since it often uses the same infrastructure and is an important part of the railway network. When comparing both, the finances behind both of systems are particularly important. Where passenger transport is largely self-sufficient in dense area's (paying users), it has a wider range and also stops at remote places, which is often based on regulations from the government. This makes passenger transport supply-orientated.

Rail freight transport is in competition with the other modes of transport: truck and barge. Rail freight transport also contains several markets, for instance: automotive, chemicals, lubricants, steel, containers and dry bulk, which all have their own market dynamics and conjuncture constraints. The volumes, hinterland connections and frequencies differ between markets and regions. This means that there is a strong relationship between economic development and rail freight. As part of this economic relationship, the development of ports and logistic centers is a determining element in rail freight business. This is one of the main differences between freight transport and passenger transport. This makes freight transport demand-orientated.

For passenger transport, concessions are issued by governments and are based on regions. These concessions ensure a frequent supply of trains, even if there are no passengers. This makes the transport system user-friendly. For freight, this is not the case. If there is no demand, then there are no trains. This is a fundamental difference. Each train, track usage or container, costs money and someone has to pay for this.

While for passenger transport, railways are used for many different distances; for freight it usually is operating at a semi-long distance. The graphic below shows how money is the main factor in choosing a transport type, which is used for commercial purposes when transporting goods. Transport costs (Y-axis) are not zero for the different modes since it represents the terminal costs for loading and unloading. D1 is the break-even point of road and rail. Up until this point, transport by road is most cost efficient. D2 is the break-even point of rail and inland shipping. Beyond this point, shipping becomes cheapest. Between D1 and D2 is where rail transport gives the lowest transport costs per unit. The graph shows that for smaller distances, road transport remains the preferred mode of transport.

An exception is the new freight route from China to Europe, which has been briefly mentioned in the previous week. This new connection makes long rail transport possible. Where it might cost more than shipping, each transport has additional advantages. Where costs often are leading, time, reliability and safety are also taken into account as well as the environment. Railways are doing very well on these factors.
