#### Week 3: Introduction

If your train was the only one, life would be so much simpler. It could leave at the desired time and take you directly to your preferred destination. There would only have to be one track, one platform, no switches and (most likely) no delay. But, when millions start using the railway network, it becomes rather complex. Passengers expect to be able to travel at any time to any place, and unfortunately, both trains and the infrastructure have limited capacity.

We have local trains, intercity trains, high speed trains and freight trains, whose networks are all connected. Strategic and robust timetabling is essential to ensure comfort, reliability and safety. But that is only one piece of the operations-puzzle: if something unforeseen happens, people have to be able to adjust at the moment, in order to keep the inconvenience to a minimum. The challenge is not to make the perfect timetable on paper, but the one that is adaptable to the unexpected challenges that can happen at any moment: real-time traffic control.
