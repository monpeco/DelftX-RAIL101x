#### Week 3: Introduction

If your train was the only one, life would be so much simpler. It could leave at the desired time and take you directly to your preferred destination. There would only have to be one track, one platform, no switches and (most likely) no delay. But, when millions start using the railway network, it becomes rather complex. Passengers expect to be able to travel at any time to any place, and unfortunately, both trains and the infrastructure have limited capacity.

We have local trains, intercity trains, high speed trains and freight trains, whose networks are all connected. Strategic and robust timetabling is essential to ensure comfort, reliability and safety. But that is only one piece of the operations-puzzle: if something unforeseen happens, people have to be able to adjust at the moment, in order to keep the inconvenience to a minimum. The challenge is not to make the perfect timetable on paper, but the one that is adaptable to the unexpected challenges that can happen at any moment: real-time traffic control.

Trains, timetabling and time zones
Back in the 1840s, trains started to become a more common way of transportation in the United Kingdom, after the first passenger railway network was developed. Before the railways were built, communities across the UK set their clocks according to their own local time. Bristol, for example, was 10 minutes behind Greenwich Mean Time. This was fine for as long as the pace of life was governed by the natural speed of humans and horses, but the advent of a fast, structured form of transport through the railways, meant that a standardized system of time became imperative.

Various parts of the country working on slightly different, locally-agreed time posed a safety risk - not to mention, the difficulty in constructing understandable timetables. The Great Western Railway had already adopted standardized time, but it was the Railway Clearing House – a body set up to apportion financial receipts among the many private railway companies – that set the pace elsewhere. It decreed in 1847 that all railway companies should operate using GMT, and by 1855, the vast majority of towns and cities had complied. Clocks were set to a signal, set to GMT, which was sent along the newly-installed telegraph system.
