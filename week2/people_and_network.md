#### Introduction

Railways connect us on a local, national and international scale and while they, like airplanes, may cover a large part of your journey, they rarely take you to your final destination directly. This week, we will take a closer look at the different forms of transport connecting the railway network to the transport that takes you from door-to-door. 

We will discuss the design and structure of railway stations, the people-flow within and around them, and the value of a large station to the city on a social, demographical, economic and architectural level. We will also look at international examples of how railways influence the urban scale and, sometimes, even can form barriers dividing a city. Trains can also cause a nuisance for the surrounding areas through noise and vibrations. This and other aspects will be explained, to help you to get a better sense of the positive and negative effects of train-travel. Limitations can be set by the urban structures, nature, but also by people through regulations, which can be very different per country.

During this week, we also introduce our interactive railway game for you to experience some of these challenges for yourself.

#### Door-to-Door

Travelling by train is more than a train ride: in fact, it is an experience that starts and ends outside the borders of the station and rail network. The video below shows the customer's journey from door-to-door.  

There are many different ways to enter or leave the railway station. You can call a cab, use your own car or transfer to/from another transportation network.

Transport companies can anticipate on the customer's journey as well. A good example of a service offered by a railway company is the OV-bike in the Netherlands. You can rent a bike for a small amount of money at many train stations and some metro stops, bus stops and park+ride (P+R) sites. The bicycles are always available, which allows the traveller to continue his/her journey. These bikes are available for every passenger that holds a season-ticket for public transportation.

#### User Types

In many countries, passengers are central to railway systems, because they are the consumers, whose needs and expectations need to be fulfilled. Thus, it is important to first know who these travellers are and what their wishes and demands are, before developing a railway network.

We can distinguish principally between two passenger types: "must"; and "lust" passengers - or those who travel for work or school with a predefined schedule, and those who travel for enjoyment, such as tourists.

#### User Requirements

Both types of traveller meet a common obstacle in the station though: transferring to another network. The railway station has two identities:

* The station as a node - a point of access to trains and transfer to other transportation networks.
* At the same time, it is an urban location, part of a city with infrastructure and a collection of buildings and open spaces. This creates opportunities to improve the experience of travellers waiting for their transfer.

The pyramid model (below) shows the requirements that need to be met at stations to satisfy the travellers.

If the standard of one of the levels is not high enough for the passenger, the whole experience in the station will be affected.

'Safety and reliability' is the baseline, which needs to be up to a certain standard (depending on the country), otherwise, the travellers will avoid the station entirely. However, the importance of the other requirements differs.

Speed and ease of travelling through a station are generic requirements but are potentially even more important for commuters than leisure travellers. If those factors are not met, a negative impression is generated.

If passengers have to spend time at a station, for instance between trains, then comfort and experience, which refers to sheltered waiting areas and the availability of facilities, such as shops, are possibly more important.

Above, we spoke about how safety and reliability need to be up to a certain standard, depending on the country. Below, you are welcome to submit some of your country's requirements. This can include special requirements to aid those with disabilities. This is not a graded discussion.
