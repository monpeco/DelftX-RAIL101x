#### Introduction

Railways connect us on a local, national and international scale and while they, like airplanes, may cover a large part of your journey, they rarely take you to your final destination directly. This week, we will take a closer look at the different forms of transport connecting the railway network to the transport that takes you from door-to-door. 

We will discuss the design and structure of railway stations, the people-flow within and around them, and the value of a large station to the city on a social, demographical, economic and architectural level. We will also look at international examples of how railways influence the urban scale and, sometimes, even can form barriers dividing a city. Trains can also cause a nuisance for the surrounding areas through noise and vibrations. This and other aspects will be explained, to help you to get a better sense of the positive and negative effects of train-travel. Limitations can be set by the urban structures, nature, but also by people through regulations, which can be very different per country.

During this week, we also introduce our interactive railway game for you to experience some of these challenges for yourself.

#### Door-to-Door

Travelling by train is more than a train ride: in fact, it is an experience that starts and ends outside the borders of the station and rail network. The video below shows the customer's journey from door-to-door.  

There are many different ways to enter or leave the railway station. You can call a cab, use your own car or transfer to/from another transportation network.

Transport companies can anticipate on the customer's journey as well. A good example of a service offered by a railway company is the OV-bike in the Netherlands. You can rent a bike for a small amount of money at many train stations and some metro stops, bus stops and park+ride (P+R) sites. The bicycles are always available, which allows the traveller to continue his/her journey. These bikes are available for every passenger that holds a season-ticket for public transportation.

#### User Types

In many countries, passengers are central to railway systems, because they are the consumers, whose needs and expectations need to be fulfilled. Thus, it is important to first know who these travellers are and what their wishes and demands are, before developing a railway network.

We can distinguish principally between two passenger types: "must"; and "lust" passengers - or those who travel for work or school with a predefined schedule, and those who travel for enjoyment, such as tourists.

---

#### User Requirements

Both types of traveller meet a common obstacle in the station though: transferring to another network. The railway station has two identities:

* The station as a node - a point of access to trains and transfer to other transportation networks.
* At the same time, it is an urban location, part of a city with infrastructure and a collection of buildings and open spaces. This creates opportunities to improve the experience of travellers waiting for their transfer.

The pyramid model (below) shows the requirements that need to be met at stations to satisfy the travellers.

![Pyramid](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/09660d355149c8421cefc7e6a24384f2/asset-v1:DelftX+RAIL101x+3T2018+type@asset+block/pyramid.png)


If the standard of one of the levels is not high enough for the passenger, the whole experience in the station will be affected.

'Safety and reliability' is the baseline, which needs to be up to a certain standard (depending on the country), otherwise, the travellers will avoid the station entirely. However, the importance of the other requirements differs.

Speed and ease of travelling through a station are generic requirements but are potentially even more important for commuters than leisure travellers. If those factors are not met, a negative impression is generated.

If passengers have to spend time at a station, for instance between trains, then comfort and experience, which refers to sheltered waiting areas and the availability of facilities, such as shops, are possibly more important.

Above, we spoke about how safety and reliability need to be up to a certain standard, depending on the country. Below, you are welcome to submit some of your country's requirements. This can include special requirements to aid those with disabilities. This is not a graded discussion.

#### Passenger Comfort

There are multiple ways to improve the door-to-door experience. Especially over the past decades, rail transport has become more and more about comfort, both in the train and the station. With more technology in our daily life, people also expect public transport to be better facilitated.

A comfortable journey can be based on many different factors, but essential factors relate to waiting, finding your way, and comfort during the ride, by means of sufficient and decent seating and a steady train ride.


##### Train travel - Hunting
In week 1, we looked at the swinging motion (hunting). This is created by the cone-shaped wheels, which enable a train to make a turn, but also have an effect on the comfort of passengers. You might have experienced this 'swinging motion’ when travelling on a train, even on perfectly straight parts of the track. 

The frequency of the ‘hunting’ motion increases with higher speeds. Furthermore, you can reduce the frequency by a decrease in the slope of the conicity. As explained in week 1, if the wheels were flat, there would not be any ‘hunting’. The slope of the conicity is, therefore, a compromise between reducing ‘hunting’ and being able to run through curves.

In modern bogies, wheelsets are mounted with suspension. This suspension dampens the ‘hunting’ behaviour of the train, thus avoiding an unpleasant journey. It also makes it possible to run very fast without passengers experiencing the swinging motion at all, as can be seen in the video above.

##### Train travel - What happened to the ‘Clickety-Clack’?
In the early days of railway transport, the track was placed and simply bolted together tightly from point A to point B. For short distances, this worked fine, but with longer distances, a problem occurred: when the temperature rose, the track would suddenly form an S curve, where it was straight before. This phenomenon is called ‘buckling’. 

The track buckles because a rise in temperature causes the tracks' steel to expand. Small expansions are not a problem, but when these become larger, the ballast and sleepers cannot hold the track in place anymore.

#### Passenger Comfort 2


##### New train designs and technology
Trains travelling over long (international) distances have been rather luxurious from the very beginning, whereas trains for daily use were designed to just move people, regardless of comfort. Metro trains are a good example of this since most people travel with them for less than 15 minutes. However, in commuter trains, facilities have increased rapidly over the past years to include more comfortable seating, wifi, power outlets, room for laptops and onboard catering.

In addition, travel information is much more detailed and is brought to customers in real-time. With the ubiquity of mobile devices with the internet nowadays, apps play an important role in this. Especially when your route changes or when you miss your regular connections, phones bring the next best solution in seconds. New interstate trains within the Netherlands even are equipped with GPS-signals, so travellers know exactly where each train is. Waiting becomes much less frustrating when you know what the problem is and how long it will take before the next train arrives.

###### Station
Another prominent way to increase comfort is to add value to the railway station itself, which we will look at in more detail in the next section. To introduce this topic we can already define three different levels in which the station and the surrounding area can enhance the travellers' experience.

##### Acceleration
For most commuters, the station is a transition point, so their station experience is most improved if their time spent there is reduced. This is possible by increasing the average speed of the train and reducing waiting times at the station. However, while passengers want shorter waiting times at the stations, especially the commuter, if a train is delayed, this can result in passengers missing the next transfer, so a careful balance must be found. More information about this topic and timetabling will be in week 3 of this course.
Enhancement
Thus, if you must wait, another way to make time at the station more pleasant is to enhance the time spent there. This can be achieved by transforming the enforced idleness of waiting into beneficial time, by making more facilities available, such as shops and cafes, but this can also be a library, exhibition or music.
Concentration
In addition, if your station is conveniently located, then travellers don't need to rely on (and further wait for) other modes of transport to get from door-to-door. Thus concentrating facilities, such as housing, companies and leisure centres, closer to the station in greater densities enhance the station's centrality. Other transport modes for getting to or leaving the railway station will then be eliminated, which will remove much of the hustle.

#### Station Design 1

This chapter will give you more information about the different aspects of a train station. Not only is a station a junction in a train-track network, it has an influence on the city and urban structure as well. Besides that, it will have an impact on the traveller's experience. 

Arriving passengers get their first impression of a city from its station. Municipalities do realise this and are investing a lot in the city's train station. They hire famous architects to design the train station and try to make it more than just a place to depart or transfer. It also becomes a place to connect people and urban areas, through the way the station building is structured. 

Finding a balance between being a mobility junction (not only for trains), having an attractive surrounding and having development opportunities around it, will make it a wanted place for investors. Especially considering how many cities grow toward their stations.

A good, functioning station is essential for the social, economic, political and urban development of a city. That is why this chapter starts with a few examples of interesting train stations. This will mainly focus on the way they are architecturally designed and what influence this has on the urban area around it. After that, we will elaborate on different aspects of the station that influence the passenger’s experience. 

##### Liège-Guillemins Station
Location: Liège, Belgium

Architect: Santiago Calatrava

Development: The original train station of Liège was opened in 1842. However, this station didn’t meet the needs of 21st-century travel, so a new station was planned. Calatrava was the architect assigned to design this new station. On September 18th, 2009, the station was opened. 

Architecture: The station is built with steel, glass and white concrete, fitting Calatrava’s signature style. Special about this station is its facade. Calatrava told the Belgian railway staff the following about it: "We completely reinvented the facade. Or, better, we said, 'There is no longer a facade.'" (source: The Guardian) There is no main facade on one side, but instead, the building is opened in every direction.

Network and scales: One of the reasons for Liège to built a new train station was the coming of the high-speed train to the city. So next to local trains entering the station, it is also connected to the international network.

##### Tianjin West Station
Location: Tianjin, China

Architect: Gerkan, Marg and Partners Architects (GMP)

Development: In 2008, renovation work on the station of Tianjin started. At the same time, China worked on a high-speed train track between Beijing and Shanghai. For this, they increased the number of platforms in Tianjin. However, a renovated station wasn’t enough, so they also planned a new station. This new station is opened in the summer of 2011.

Architecture: The station is designed by the firm Gerkan, Marg and partners and has a big impact on the city of Tianjin. It is part of a big urban restructuring project and the station connects the commercial north with the old centre of the city in the south. The architects symbolised this connecting character in the roof construction.

Network and scales: As said, the station also houses the high-speed train. This is served by Jinghu High-Speed Railway. The station is also served by Jinghu Railway and Jinbao Railway and is in that way part of the regional network.

You can reach the station by foot, taxi, bus and metro.

#### Station Design 2

##### Logroño High-Speed Train Station
Location: Logroño, Rioja, Spain

Architect: Abalos + Sentkiewicz Architects

Development: Logroño already had a station, but it needed to be updated to accommodate the coming of the high-speed train. Abalos + Sentkiewicz Architects won the competition and were assigned to design the station. The new station is part of a bigger urban planning and landscape development project.

Architecture: With this station, they wanted to connect the north and south of the city of Logroño. The architects tried to do this by creating a public park on the roof of this transportation hub which stimulated urban and social integration. It gives pedestrians and cyclist an opportunity for easier mobility.

Network and scales: The high-speed network is operated by Renfe, the Spanish national railway company, and connects Logroño with Madrid, Barcelona en Bilbao. The station is next to the national network, and also connects with the regional one.

##### Grand Central Station, New York, United States
Location: New York City, United States

Architect: Reed and Stem; Warren and Wetmore

Development: Between 1899 and 1900, a lot of renovation work was performed on Grand Central Station in New York. But because of a crash in the Park Avenue Tunnel on the north side of the station, a decision to build a new Grand Central Station was taken. This station had to, unlike the old one, fit the growing metropolis. After a competition, two architectural firms won and were chosen to make the new design. Those firms were Reed & Stem and Warren & Wetmore.

Architecture: Reed & Stem and Warren & Wetmore agreed to work together under the name of Associated Architects of Grand Central Terminal. The overall design was the responsibility of Reed & Stem, Warren & Wetmore made sure architectural details were included in the design.

Under the ground, there are two levels of train tracks and platforms. On the higher level, the main trains arrive, and at the lower level, the suburban trains stop. Because all the train tracks are underground, there is space to develop real estate above. The construction of the building is strong enough to carry a tower that still can be built.

Network and scales: Grand Central Station has 44 platforms and 67 train tracks and is in that way connected to the regional and national network, as well as the New York subway. Grand Central Station is the biggest terminus station in the world.

#### Station Domains

##### The Station
There are many different kinds of stations, but what they all have in common is that they are a place of coming and going - a link between the train ride and the environment. This chapter shows that the station is more than a technical and functional building. It is a public space where the traveller’s experience is a focus point.

We can divide the station into different domains, each of which has a separate but interconnected purpose, and signs that create clarity for the travellers and give them the information, orientation and facilities needed.  

![domains](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/ab48fe2e25159fb01848caea59a8bc5e/asset-v1:DelftX+RAIL101x+3T2018+type@asset+block/Domeinen.png)

The different train station domains (image by TUDelft)

##### Environmental domain
The environmental domain ensures that the departing passengers can easily and safely find the station and that the arriving passengers are provided with facilities to continue their journey. The setup for this domain is based on pedestrians, with clear transitions and signs to other kinds of transportation, such as parking lots, the kiss-and-ride, the metro station.
Entrance domain
The entrance domain is where the passengers come inside the station and prepare their journey. It is possible to find information about arriving and departing trains (for instance on overhead screens) and to buy train tickets (from ticket machines or counters).

##### Travel domain
The travel domain is all about moving easily and efficiently to and from the train. It is also possible to get information about the timetable here, for instance. Aside from that, it needs to give the passenger peace of mind (by creating space) to depart and transfer to another train or give comfortable options, like seats, when the passenger has to wait for a short time.
Accommodation domain
The accommodation domain is mostly part of the bigger train stations or terminals in a country. Transfer time is often seen as a waste of time by passengers. This domain offers a solution by offering different kind of facilities, such as retail, catering and services to improve the comfort of waiting.
An example of an unusual service in the accommodation domain is the 'Station Library' in Haarlem, The Netherlands. This started as a two-year trial, to make commuters enthusiastic about going to a library in an easily accessible way. Nowadays, the library has an up-to-date collection of books, a fast service and a broader network to pick up and return books at more stations

Not only travellers are attracted by these facilities and services, the accommodation domain also invites all types of visitors.

#### Wayfinding

Getting lost in an unknown environment can be a stressful experience. Organisations must facilitate wayfinding for their customers in order to prevent them from having negative feelings. If they get lost in a station, the "must" traveller might be late for her appointment, while the "lust" traveller might spend too much time searching for the right way, instead of relaxing.

There are multiple ways to help travellers navigate through a station:

1. Signage: You can use clarifying signs, which show the different facilities and directions. These signs need to be understandable for all types of travellers, native, foreign and differently-abled.

2. Station Layout: The station layout has a huge influence on the wayfinding, even though it is less obvious. The complexity of a building needs to be low enough, so the travellers can absorb all the information around them, and give them a clear overview of the environment. Main paths (often delineated through floor colouring or lighting) and the visibility of orientation spots (for example the entrance, escalators) within the station can help the traveller navigate the overview (Werner & Long, 2003). Aside from this, differentiation is important, to distinguish the spaces from each other. By working with the four different domains, it will be easier for the traveller to figure out where he/she is.

The Hague Central Station
The following example shows The Hague Central Station and its different station domains including corresponding signs. The station has four floors, but this example will only show two of them.

The Hague Central station is an easy-to-read building, where multiple public transportation networks converge. The station building includes all modes of transportation: train, tram and bus. Inside, the trams ride along an elevated track above the train tracks. Retail and hospitality areas can be taken in at a glance. Nowadays, about 190 000 travellers and passers-by make use of The Hague Central Station, but this renovated building was built to host double this amount, in order to fulfil the needs for the coming decade. To facilitate this huge number of travellers, they designed a natural and flexible organisation of traffic flows. Multiple routes are possible, in order to let the traveller create their own route in an easy and clear way.

---

#### Crowd Sensing

##### Crowd Management
After developing a good wayfinding system in a train station, it is necessary to track and predict the pedestrian flow. When you have the right data and findings, you can improve the ease and speed of walking through the station. This will directly increase the customer satisfaction, but maybe, more importantly, will increase the safety in the station as well. 

First, the pedestrian flow needs to be monitored in order to get a good overview of what is happening. This can be done by different kind of sensors/tools, such as cameras, wifi-spots, Bluetooth or location trackers. This data collection will include the number of visitors, densities and walking speed. When there is a big event going on and they expect a big crowd, they even check social media sources to know who the visitors are and what they are talking about (see the flowchart below). With this information, they can determine the level of service they want to provide to the travellers and the potentially dangerous situations that might occur. 

When the right data is gathered about the pedestrian flow, predictions and decisions can be made to develop the train station. The following golden rules provide solutions of where to act and when improving the crowd management with the data. 

1. Increase throughput at pinch points in the design.
2. Prevent blockades by separating flows in different directions.
3. Distribute traffic over available infrastructure by means of guidance or information provision
4. Limit the inflow (gating) ensuring that the number of pedestrians stays below the critical value.

The videos (below) show how to solve major crowd management problems. One is a train station in Santiago, where the daily pedestrian flow caused difficulties when moving out of the station. This was solved by separating the flows in different directions (direction 2). The other video shows the improvements of information provision during emergencies in a train station in Barcelona (direction 3).

#### Fun fact or good story?

Each week we have hidden a story related to the main topic discussed. Do you have any other fun facts affiliated with People and the Railway Network? Share your knowledge on the forum below.

One station, four continents
Did you know Flinders Street Station in Melbourne, Australia and the Luz Station in Sao Paulo, South America have a surprising number of similarities, being 13100 km apart, but both established by the English, Europe. You also might recognise some of the East-Indian inspired design in Melbourne. This is most likely due to the fact that the original plan was to use the drawings for Melbourne's most famous station for another project in Mumbai, Asia. The story goes that the shipments were wrongly labelled and two stations were fully constructed at the wrong locations.

#### Urban Barrier or Opportunity

Railways, particularly stations, can greatly add to a city, both as a hub for new business and as an architectural landmark. We will look at different ways how the railway network influences its surroundings, dealing with both environmental and urban limits and challenges. Before getting into detail on nuisance, we will start this section by analysing how railway tracks can either form a physical and/or social barrier and when this can be an opportunity rather than a problem.

##### Southbank London, United Kingdom
Situation: The Southbank Centre of the river Thames in London has been in developing since the early 1950s when the festival of Britain was organised. Over the years it became a cultural arts district next to the railway line connecting Embankment Station across the Thames. Where one side of the track has extremely flourished, the other side became a setting where no one wanted to come. The station and its lifted rail track have dominated the area, cutting the Southbank into two. 

In the central image above the yellow lines represent the ideal way to walk towards Waterloo Station, London's largest railway station which is used by over close to a hundred million each year. These travellers are mostly commuting and tend to use the fastest way. The blue/green lines represent how people actually walk, which are different routes, avoiding the undeveloped site of the Southbank. Lastly, the purple dots are where people feel unsafe, where the blue, green and yellow dots are where they would like to be. The railway bridge forms an extreme barrier between both.

Opportunity: Where Allies and Morrison successfully developed the northern side of the railway in 2007, multiple competitions had been launched over the years to integrate both sides. In 1999 Rick Mather Architects was selected to make a masterplan for the Southbank. To start with the master plan, a few important principles were established; accessibility, legibility and the public realm. They aimed for a greater mix of users also for longer periods of the day. 

Where the master plan was never fully realised, multiple architecture firms and landscape designers got involved in this challenging project. Where Allies and Morrison made follow-up plans for further development of the Southbank Center, new competitions were launched to integrate the railway track. West 8 started working on maximising the public space in the Jubilee Gardens on the south side (close to the London Eye).

Between 2007 and 2013, three public squares have been created on the side of Royal Festival Hall, Hayward Gallery and Queen Elizabeth Hall, the ‘liner’ building was placed on the north side of the Railway Bridge, making a new pedestrian route onto the Hungerford Bridges and shielding the public space and Royal Festival Hall from the high lifted railway and the Jubilee Gardens were developed into a high-quality park. Enough potential to make the connection, but the car park next to the railway bridge stayed empty.


##### High Line New York City, The United States of America
Situation: the High Line in New York was originally built for the transportation of meat and poultry, and was finished in 1934. The line is 2,3 kilometres long and runs parallel to 10th Avenue. Because the popularity of automobile transportation increased, the last train to use the line was in 1980. 

The High Line is, as the name implies, higher than ground level. In this way, it has created a form of barrier in the city. 

Opportunity: Around 2003 plans to give the unused high line a new purpose were developed. The city council of New York decided to turn the line into a park. This park is designed by the Dutch architect Piet Oudolf. In 2009, the first part of the park opened for visitors and has been a success since then. Instead of being a barrier, the High Line now connects people and urban space.

##### Railway Master Plan Delft, The Netherlands
Situation: The train track in Delft dates from 1847 and was built on the west side of the city. Later, the city grew and the track no longer bordered the city but split it in two. The solution for this was to lift the train track on its own railway arch, and underneath this viaduct, parking placed were created. However, this made it an unpleasant area, which was experienced as a barrier in the city. As railway traffic expanded, the double track viaduct became a bottleneck in the rail connection between the cities of Rotterdam and Amsterdam.

Opportunity: The urge to solve this unwanted situation grew and eventually a 2,3 kilometre-long railway tunnel including an underground station was built instead. Putting the train track underground meant a lot of space on ground level was opened up. This made it possible to redesign the Rail Zone in Delft. The design also included plans to reconstruct the canal that was once parallel to the train track, make room for a park, build houses and other facilities, like a school. In addition, the old train station has been replaced by a new one. The first part of the tunnel was opened in 2015, with 2 tracks available. After removing the old railway viaduct the construction of the second part started which will be taken into service by the end of 2019.  

##### Did you know?

In early years stations were often placed on elevated platforms. This way a train approaching the station 'automatically' would decrease in speed, where trains leaving the station would gain it. Both usually cost a lot of power, which was saved by a smart way of designing.

#### Noise and Vibration

As an infrastructural network, railways have a great influence on their surroundings. As a continuous element through connecting cities and countries and actual interfaces with our road/pedestrian network like stations and crossings. In some cases, this includes nuisance for surrounding areas.

##### Noise and Vibration
The effect of a railway extends beyond the convenience of travel or the offerings of its related stations. In this section, we will examine the impact on the immediate surrounding of a railway line.

A train generates noise and vibration hindrance for both people living close to a railway and people on the train. But where does this hindrance come from and how can it be reduced?

The track consists of different elements made out of different materials, for example, the rail pad, sleeper and ballast. Having different elements results in different levels of stiffness on the track. The displacement at the point where a sleeper is located will be less than the point where it is not, because the rigidity is higher. An optimal situation would be to have a constant stiffness throughout the whole track. Since this is not possible, however, it is important to limit the stiffness variation as much as possible.

When a train moves and interacts with this uneven track, it creates an energy flux or input. Part of this energy flux will be absorbed by the track which causes deterioration of the components. More maintenance activities are needed to repair the damage to the track. The other part will be transmitted through the soil and the air in the form of vibration radiation and environmental noise.

Unfortunately, it is really difficult to reduce this noise and vibration due to the dynamic force of the train on the track, but there are three ways to limit the hindrance:
1.Noise and vibration reduction at the source (e.g. elastic pads under the sleeper, ballast mat)
2.Noise and vibration reduction at the receiver (e.g. pads in the support of houses)
3.Noise and vibration reduction between the source and the receiver (e.g. barriers such as walls, trenches)

##### Additional sources of noise

Besides this standard contact noise, also other factors can introduce extra noise. For example, a wheel flat of the train will create an impact on the rail at each rotation of the wheel. This impact creates an extra vibration, which can clearly be heard while standing next to the track during the passing of a train with wheel flats. In the video on the left, you can hear wheel flats especially on the front end of the train.

Another noise that is commonly heard close to stations and in curves is a high-pitched squeaking noise. This noise is being generated by the contact of the wheel flange and the rail. This is common in switches since in this case, the rail can have no cant, but also in curves, this will happen when different trains tend to pass at different speeds. As seen last week also tram lines have this problem since they can not have any cant in the curves. A good example of flange squeal can be heard in the video on the right.

These forms of noise production, due to having a specific cause, can more easily be targeted. For the deformation of the wheels, frequent inspection of the wheels can reduce the problems. Also microphones next to the track can help in identifying problematic wheels.

For flange squeal, a reduction of switches and standardization of speeds in the curves can reduce the problem. When this is not possible lubrication can be added to reduce the noise.

#### Bridges and Tunnels

Constructing a railway network can be influenced by cities or environmental obstacles: mountains, rivers or any change of soil can be a challenge either during the design or at a later stage due to track settlement. In week 4 and 5 we will look at both disruption that might come from this as well as maintaining critical parts of the network, but in this section the common design solutions are discussed, by means of tunnels and bridges, to adapt to these limitations. This can be best explored by looking at some international examples.

The Gotthard is the world's longest and deepest traffic tunnel. Shifting freight volumes from trucks to trains also made the transportation safer and reduced environmental damage. It also provides a faster connection for travellers, cutting the journey time from Basel to Milan by an hour.

Chenab Bridge is a railway steel and concrete arch bridge between Bakkal and Kauri in India. When finished, the bridge will span the Chenab River at a height of 359 m (1,178 ft) above the river, making it the world's highest rail bridge.

The Chongqing Metro line 2 Monorail in China passes right through an apartment building, creating an unusual sight. With most of the area being slopes (the city is called 'mountain city'), this solution was found to create a light rail system.


Sometimes issues coming from large projects like these, are not directly related to the construction, planning or usage of the railway track. After the new underground railway station in Delft, The Netherlands opened to the public in 2015, an unexpected issue occurred that very same day. When trains passed by faster than 80 km/h the revolving doors within the station entrance hall would turn at a very fast speed, creating inconvenient, sometimes dangerous, but for bystanders rather funny situations.

No-one thought before opening to have trains pass by at regulated speed. It was supposed to be an event which reached all news channels and it did, but probably not in the way the stakeholders would have planned it.


##### 255 meter moved into place
One of the largest projects involving a bridge within The Netherlands is the expansion of the A1 highway connecting Amsterdam to the east. To retain the existing railway connections, a bridge of 255 meters had to be designed which was constructed next to the highway and moved to its location as one element. With a total weight of 84000 kN and a height of 59 meters a complex venture.

Since soil calculations showed that the highway was not able to hold such a load, it had to be reinforced and due to the height and length of the bridge, it was a necessity to make limit elevation to a minimal (where highways usually have several percent elevation for drainage).

Below an animation (in Dutch) of building and moving the bridge (left) and a time-lapse of the actual event (right).

The transport was done by special vehicles, having 488 wheels on each side and moving only 1 meter per minute. The allowed vertical deformation was 50mm which together with all other factors took over a year of planning. A specific day was chosen to limit the inconvenience by a minimal. There was no big concert in or around Amsterdam, no sporting event and road traffic could be redirected via other routes.

Everything still could have been called off on the day itself by the one factor you cannot control: wind. If wind speed would have exceeded the maximum 49 km/h the project would have been cancelled after detailed planning with hundreds involved.

This obviously is an extreme example, but it shows how many factors can be involved if civil structures are needed within the railway network.

#### Transition Zones

In the previous section, we talked about obstacles in the environment and how they can be tackled with bridges and tunnels. This section will be about the transition zone, the zone between the free track and the fixed structure (e.g bridge). Due to different problems that occur in this zone, transition zones often require additional maintenance.  These problems can be solved, but these solutions are costly. 

The video below depicts an athlete jumping from a springboard onto a raised platform: how do you think the gymnast's movement can relate to the transition zone?


##### Dynamic Behaviour
Railway track designs are based on static behaviour, which can be the reason that they encounter dynamic problems in the transition zone (i.e the first few meters of track connected to the fixed structure).

When the normal track is built on top of softer subsoil (which is often the case around rivers, for example), the weight of the track itself, combined with a load of passing trains, will cause subsidence in this subsoil. The bridge, however, of which the foundation reaches the deeper stable layers of soil, is not subject to this subsidence. Due to this, over time a difference in height between the bridge and the normal track will be introduced. Since the rail is continuously welded, in the transition zone, this height difference is overcome gradually, but this will mean some sleepers at this transition zone are not well supported by the ballast.

The introduced height difference has to be overcome by any train passing over this bridge. This means a vertical acceleration of the train is required at the transition zone. The force of this vertical acceleration means an additional load on the transition zone, which is repeated at every passage of a train. This increased load at the transition zone, results in extra subsidence in this zone, thus further increasing the problem.

Due to the newly-created difference in height at the transition zone, the sleepers are no longer properly supported by the ballast. Thus, in the end, not only are the forces in the transition zone higher due to the acceleration, but there is also less support. This means the rail has to deal with far higher internal stresses than seen in other locations on the track. Damages to the rail itself are thus far more likely to occur at this location, and at worst case result in a derailment.

Aside from the technical issues, passenger comfort is also negatively influenced by the transition zone. The subsidence in the transition zone has a similar effect on a train as a springboard has on a gymnast. The train will first jump down into the 'hole' in the track, after which it has to be launched upwards to reach the same level as the bridge. This can be clearly noticed by passengers on the train. When nothing is done about the problem, this effect will just keep worsening over time, and can even cause passengers to fall over while standing on the train. 

Many solutions are currently used to reduce the effects seen in a transition zone, such as the use of wider sleepers (to reduce internal stresses in the soil) and adding extra rails (to increase the stiffness and reduce the stresses in the rail). Some more advanced solutions have been proposed as well, such as placing a balloon underneath the transition zone, which can be automatically inflated to counteract the height difference. Another solution can be a construction in the shape of a slope to create a smooth transition. Although all these solutions can help in reducing the problem, none of those will prevent all the dynamic problems that will occur. The only real solution would be to make the foundation of the track the same over the whole length of the track, thus rather than using ballast track, using slab track with deep foundations. This, however, is very expensive to do and by itself will introduce completely different problems.

#### City Scale

In this chapter, the differences between railway networks in terms of scale will be explained by means of international examples. There are, for instance, differences in distance (stops), speed, and comfort at the city scale, national scale and international scale, using specific train types.

We look at the cities of Seoul, London and Sydney. If you have additional details on one of these networks, please feel free to use the discussion at the bottom to share with other users. For follow-up runs of this MOOC, we can add your facts and experiences to make this section more complete.

In week 6, it will be possible to add local and regional systems/network from other cities and countries, which will be visualised on the world map.


##### Seoul
The Seoul Metropolitan Subway is world's longest multi-operator metro system by route length, but is also known as one of the most comfortable public transportation networks of the world, due to its cleanliness and ease of use. With a network that consists of 9 lines, around eight million customers can travel properly in Seoul City and its surroundings on daily basis. Most of the system is operated by the following three companies: Seoul Metro, Korail and Metro 9. 
 
Advanced technology, such as Wifi, is accessible in all stations and trains. In addition, other luxurious conveniences, such as heated seats, tv screens with news and plenty of legroom make the customer's journey comfortable. Customers are able to use the smart payment system at every line. This technology makes it possible to pay automatically by smart cards, smartphones or credit cards. 

##### London
London's metro network, also known as the Underground or the Tube, serves London and some parts of the counties Buckinghamshire, Essex and Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom. With 11 lines and 402 kilometres of railway, the London Underground is the third longest network in the world. Besides that, it is also known as the oldest network in the world, because the first line was build in 1863.  The Underground network consists of 9 zones, where central London is zone 1. Due to the urbanisation in the 19th century, there was a lack of space in London, which made authorities decide to build a rail under the ground. The average depth level of the rails is 20 meters underground, where metro-station Hampstead on the Northern line is the deepest station, that runs down to 58.5 metres. 

The Tube brings around 3 million people to their destination a day. During a weekday this is even higher with an average of 3.4 million travellers, where Waterloo station is the busiest metro-station. 

For lots of travellers worldwide, the Underground is recognisable and famous by its Roundel. This blue and red sign was first used in 1908. The 100th anniversary of the Roundel was celebrated in 2008 by 100 artists, that made posters of the design. 

London's metro network connects different important railway stations within Greater London. Like in many European cities in the early years, railways were operated by private companies, each having its own access point. Famous stations like Charing Cross, Waterloo and Liverpool Street Station all have large passenger numbers but are not connected with each other by continuous railway lines.

Many of London's railway stations are internationally known due to their size, history and design. In multiple occasions these settings have been used as film locations, of which Harry Potter at King's Cross is probably the most famous. In week 6 we will look at famous movie scenes in which either trains or stations play an important part which will be visible on the world map.

##### Sydney

To cope with the extraordinary population growth, Sydney's transportation network is undergoing some major changes. Their metro line is currently the biggest public transportation project. This new railway will deliver 31 metro stations and more than 66 kilometres of new rail. To connect, Sydney the metro will be extended into the Central Business District (CBD) and beyond in 2024. The metro will run from the North West region under Sydney Harbour, through new underground stations in the CBD and beyond to the South West. 

With this new network, it will be possible to run a metro train every two minutes in each direction under the city. This means that the consumer capacity will be increased from about 24 000 travellers each hour per line to 40 000 travellers per hour. 

This new transportation network means fast, safe and reliable metros, connecting people wherever and whenever they want to go. The customers do not need timetables anymore because the metro will run frequently. Technology will serve the customers within all the different stages of their journey, giving them real-time travel information. 

Of particular interest is how commuter trains circle within the city, after entering the main (central) railway station. Trains run around the city centre, making frequent stops, creating a metro-like system. The network below looks like a metro network but is actually Sydney's regular train network. 

If you compare this scale to the London underground map above, it actually is about the same distance from one end of to the other, but central London is in the middle of the map, whereas Sydney is on the far right, requiring a different system: train vs metro.

#### Dutch Network

he Netherlands has a dense railway network connecting all major cities, as well as most larger towns, with over 400 stations in a rather small country. The largest operator (Nederlandse Spoorwegen or NS) is semi-private owned and is mainly focussed on passenger transport during both day and night. The NS has two different groups of trains:
•The 'Sprinter' or 'local train' is made for commuters that need to travel short distances and stops at both smaller and larger railway stations. The average travel time is around 15 minutes with this train. It stops at all stations. 
•The 'Intercity' or 'interstate train' is made for travellers that need to travel longer distances. These trains stop only at the larger train stations. The comfortable design and facilities in this train are adapted to a longer travel time.

Besides NS, there are more companies that operate in The Netherlands, mostly within specific states (provinces) as well as different freight companies. The infrastructural network, on which they all operate, is managed by a different semi-private party (ProRail), which is responsible for allocating slots to the different companies. The complexity in the network arises from different preferences in the transport. The focus of the passenger network is not only on frequent connections between big cities but also on making as many direct connections as possible. In general, any combination of the intercity station can be linked with a maximum of one transfer.

Direct intercity lines for example run from Groningen to Rotterdam, Enschede to Den Haag (The Hague), and Maastricht to Alkmaar. All these links span around 200 km, which is approximately the width of the country. Furthermore, from most of the intercity stations, there is a direct link to Schiphol airport, being one of the main hubs in the Dutch network. All these direct links and long connections make that especially the central part of the network (between Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Amersfoort and Utrecht), can quickly become a logistical nightmare. Delay on just one of the long routes can influence many of the other routes crossing or sharing some of the same sections.

Besides passenger transport also freight transport has to share on parts of the same network. The main origin and destination for freight trains in the Netherlands is Rotterdam Harbour. From here freight connections are established with many places all over Europe. There is even a train link all the way to China. Although a dedicated rail-line is now available for freight trains to Germany. Due to the limited capacity once crossing the German border, not all freight-trains can use this connection at the moment. This means many freight trains still have to be sharing the passenger network as well. 

There has been a discussion on how to deal with a dense and complicated network like this, where multiple different trains use the same network en drive rather long routes. Due to the denseness of the network, a large number of switches and platforms are needed to guide all the different trains running from one side of the country to the other. A way of making the network more sufficient would be by creating circular lines which not interfere with each other. This way switches are not needed and trains have their own lines, limiting the change on disruptions and increasing both reliability as well as frequency. The video above shows how this could be implemented within The Netherlands.

#### Japanese Network

After examining the Dutch national railway infrastructure, we will take a closer look at the Japanese network, which is most famous for their punctual high-speed network. If you are a frequent user of this system, please feel free to add details and facts in the discussion at the bottom of this page to enrich others on the worldwide known bullet trains.

Rail transport in Japan primarily focuses on passengers, especially high speed and mass travel between the major cities. The most prominent operator is Japan Railways group, commonly known as "JR", which provides a service throughout the country, which is divided into six regions. This government-owned network runs the Shinkansen (bullet train) routes, which reach a maximum speed of 320km/h and operate on separate tracks from regular trains.  

In addition to this, each big city has at least one private train line that serves the city and its surroundings. In post-war Japan, the government stimulated private corporations to develop their own railway line in order to rebuild the transportation network. Nowadays, this privatised network is efficient, extremely punctually and affordable.

During rush-hour, the Shinkansen trains run as frequently as every ten minutes and sometimes even more. Most trains only have reserved seating (in Europe, this is only comparable to high-speed international trains, like Thalys). While tourists make use of this fast connections as well, they can only make reservations for specific trains, which still run multiple times an hour. Most bullet-trains are for Japanese commuting only, which creates an extremely fast and reliable network, enabling people to work and live in different main cities with limited travel time.

The high-speed train tracks have very little elevation and run right through mountains, of which there are many in Japan. It creates an extremely fast and reliable network, beating any other form of transport, like cars and airplanes. Regular trains are similar to other countries, with a great diversity of design and age.

Comparing the travel time between the cities of Sendai and Niigata gives a clear idea of the difference in rail transport. On a sky-wide distance of around 140 km, the regular trains bring you over the mountains in six to seven hours, whereas the Shinkansen takes you there in under four hours. An interesting fact, in this case, is that the Shinkansen travels over Tokyo, making the total travel distance almost 800km, but is still much faster.
