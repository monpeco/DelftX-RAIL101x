#### Introduction

Railways connect us on a local, national and international scale and while they, like airplanes, may cover a large part of your journey, they rarely take you to your final destination directly. This week, we will take a closer look at the different forms of transport connecting the railway network to the transport that takes you from door-to-door. 

We will discuss the design and structure of railway stations, the people-flow within and around them, and the value of a large station to the city on a social, demographical, economic and architectural level. We will also look at international examples of how railways influence the urban scale and, sometimes, even can form barriers dividing a city. Trains can also cause a nuisance for the surrounding areas through noise and vibrations. This and other aspects will be explained, to help you to get a better sense of the positive and negative effects of train-travel. Limitations can be set by the urban structures, nature, but also by people through regulations, which can be very different per country.

During this week, we also introduce our interactive railway game for you to experience some of these challenges for yourself.

#### Door-to-Door

Travelling by train is more than a train ride: in fact, it is an experience that starts and ends outside the borders of the station and rail network. The video below shows the customer's journey from door-to-door.  

There are many different ways to enter or leave the railway station. You can call a cab, use your own car or transfer to/from another transportation network.

Transport companies can anticipate on the customer's journey as well. A good example of a service offered by a railway company is the OV-bike in the Netherlands. You can rent a bike for a small amount of money at many train stations and some metro stops, bus stops and park+ride (P+R) sites. The bicycles are always available, which allows the traveller to continue his/her journey. These bikes are available for every passenger that holds a season-ticket for public transportation.

#### User Types

In many countries, passengers are central to railway systems, because they are the consumers, whose needs and expectations need to be fulfilled. Thus, it is important to first know who these travellers are and what their wishes and demands are, before developing a railway network.

We can distinguish principally between two passenger types: "must"; and "lust" passengers - or those who travel for work or school with a predefined schedule, and those who travel for enjoyment, such as tourists.

#### User Requirements

Both types of traveller meet a common obstacle in the station though: transferring to another network. The railway station has two identities:

* The station as a node - a point of access to trains and transfer to other transportation networks.
* At the same time, it is an urban location, part of a city with infrastructure and a collection of buildings and open spaces. This creates opportunities to improve the experience of travellers waiting for their transfer.

The pyramid model (below) shows the requirements that need to be met at stations to satisfy the travellers.

![Pyramid](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/09660d355149c8421cefc7e6a24384f2/asset-v1:DelftX+RAIL101x+3T2018+type@asset+block/pyramid.png)


If the standard of one of the levels is not high enough for the passenger, the whole experience in the station will be affected.

'Safety and reliability' is the baseline, which needs to be up to a certain standard (depending on the country), otherwise, the travellers will avoid the station entirely. However, the importance of the other requirements differs.

Speed and ease of travelling through a station are generic requirements but are potentially even more important for commuters than leisure travellers. If those factors are not met, a negative impression is generated.

If passengers have to spend time at a station, for instance between trains, then comfort and experience, which refers to sheltered waiting areas and the availability of facilities, such as shops, are possibly more important.

Above, we spoke about how safety and reliability need to be up to a certain standard, depending on the country. Below, you are welcome to submit some of your country's requirements. This can include special requirements to aid those with disabilities. This is not a graded discussion.

#### Passenger Comfort

There are multiple ways to improve the door-to-door experience. Especially over the past decades, rail transport has become more and more about comfort, both in the train and the station. With more technology in our daily life, people also expect public transport to be better facilitated.

A comfortable journey can be based on many different factors, but essential factors relate to waiting, finding your way, and comfort during the ride, by means of sufficient and decent seating and a steady train ride.


##### Train travel - Hunting
In week 1, we looked at the swinging motion (hunting). This is created by the cone-shaped wheels, which enable a train to make a turn, but also have an effect on the comfort of passengers. You might have experienced this 'swinging motion’ when travelling on a train, even on perfectly straight parts of the track. 

The frequency of the ‘hunting’ motion increases with higher speeds. Furthermore, you can reduce the frequency by a decrease in the slope of the conicity. As explained in week 1, if the wheels were flat, there would not be any ‘hunting’. The slope of the conicity is, therefore, a compromise between reducing ‘hunting’ and being able to run through curves.

In modern bogies, wheelsets are mounted with suspension. This suspension dampens the ‘hunting’ behaviour of the train, thus avoiding an unpleasant journey. It also makes it possible to run very fast without passengers experiencing the swinging motion at all, as can be seen in the video above.

##### Train travel - What happened to the ‘Clickety-Clack’?
In the early days of railway transport, the track was placed and simply bolted together tightly from point A to point B. For short distances, this worked fine, but with longer distances, a problem occurred: when the temperature rose, the track would suddenly form an S curve, where it was straight before. This phenomenon is called ‘buckling’. 

The track buckles because a rise in temperature causes the tracks' steel to expand. Small expansions are not a problem, but when these become larger, the ballast and sleepers cannot hold the track in place anymore.

#### Passenger Comfort 2


##### New train designs and technology
Trains travelling over long (international) distances have been rather luxurious from the very beginning, whereas trains for daily use were designed to just move people, regardless of comfort. Metro trains are a good example of this since most people travel with them for less than 15 minutes. However, in commuter trains, facilities have increased rapidly over the past years to include more comfortable seating, wifi, power outlets, room for laptops and onboard catering.

In addition, travel information is much more detailed and is brought to customers in real-time. With the ubiquity of mobile devices with the internet nowadays, apps play an important role in this. Especially when your route changes or when you miss your regular connections, phones bring the next best solution in seconds. New interstate trains within the Netherlands even are equipped with GPS-signals, so travellers know exactly where each train is. Waiting becomes much less frustrating when you know what the problem is and how long it will take before the next train arrives.

###### Station
Another prominent way to increase comfort is to add value to the railway station itself, which we will look at in more detail in the next section. To introduce this topic we can already define three different levels in which the station and the surrounding area can enhance the travellers' experience.

##### Acceleration
For most commuters, the station is a transition point, so their station experience is most improved if their time spent there is reduced. This is possible by increasing the average speed of the train and reducing waiting times at the station. However, while passengers want shorter waiting times at the stations, especially the commuter, if a train is delayed, this can result in passengers missing the next transfer, so a careful balance must be found. More information about this topic and timetabling will be in week 3 of this course.
Enhancement
Thus, if you must wait, another way to make time at the station more pleasant is to enhance the time spent there. This can be achieved by transforming the enforced idleness of waiting into beneficial time, by making more facilities available, such as shops and cafes, but this can also be a library, exhibition or music.
Concentration
In addition, if your station is conveniently located, then travellers don't need to rely on (and further wait for) other modes of transport to get from door-to-door. Thus concentrating facilities, such as housing, companies and leisure centres, closer to the station in greater densities enhance the station's centrality. Other transport modes for getting to or leaving the railway station will then be eliminated, which will remove much of the hustle.

#### Station Design 1

This chapter will give you more information about the different aspects of a train station. Not only is a station a junction in a train-track network, it has an influence on the city and urban structure as well. Besides that, it will have an impact on the traveller's experience. 

Arriving passengers get their first impression of a city from its station. Municipalities do realise this and are investing a lot in the city's train station. They hire famous architects to design the train station and try to make it more than just a place to depart or transfer. It also becomes a place to connect people and urban areas, through the way the station building is structured. 

Finding a balance between being a mobility junction (not only for trains), having an attractive surrounding and having development opportunities around it, will make it a wanted place for investors. Especially considering how many cities grow toward their stations.

A good, functioning station is essential for the social, economic, political and urban development of a city. That is why this chapter starts with a few examples of interesting train stations. This will mainly focus on the way they are architecturally designed and what influence this has on the urban area around it. After that, we will elaborate on different aspects of the station that influence the passenger’s experience. 

##### Liège-Guillemins Station
Location: Liège, Belgium

Architect: Santiago Calatrava

Development: The original train station of Liège was opened in 1842. However, this station didn’t meet the needs of 21st-century travel, so a new station was planned. Calatrava was the architect assigned to design this new station. On September 18th, 2009, the station was opened. 

Architecture: The station is built with steel, glass and white concrete, fitting Calatrava’s signature style. Special about this station is its facade. Calatrava told the Belgian railway staff the following about it: "We completely reinvented the facade. Or, better, we said, 'There is no longer a facade.'" (source: The Guardian) There is no main facade on one side, but instead, the building is opened in every direction.

Network and scales: One of the reasons for Liège to built a new train station was the coming of the high-speed train to the city. So next to local trains entering the station, it is also connected to the international network.

##### Tianjin West Station
Location: Tianjin, China

Architect: Gerkan, Marg and Partners Architects (GMP)

Development: In 2008, renovation work on the station of Tianjin started. At the same time, China worked on a high-speed train track between Beijing and Shanghai. For this, they increased the number of platforms in Tianjin. However, a renovated station wasn’t enough, so they also planned a new station. This new station is opened in the summer of 2011.

Architecture: The station is designed by the firm Gerkan, Marg and partners and has a big impact on the city of Tianjin. It is part of a big urban restructuring project and the station connects the commercial north with the old centre of the city in the south. The architects symbolised this connecting character in the roof construction.

Network and scales: As said, the station also houses the high-speed train. This is served by Jinghu High-Speed Railway. The station is also served by Jinghu Railway and Jinbao Railway and is in that way part of the regional network.

You can reach the station by foot, taxi, bus and metro.

#### Station Design 2

##### Logroño High-Speed Train Station
Location: Logroño, Rioja, Spain

Architect: Abalos + Sentkiewicz Architects

Development: Logroño already had a station, but it needed to be updated to accommodate the coming of the high-speed train. Abalos + Sentkiewicz Architects won the competition and were assigned to design the station. The new station is part of a bigger urban planning and landscape development project.

Architecture: With this station, they wanted to connect the north and south of the city of Logroño. The architects tried to do this by creating a public park on the roof of this transportation hub which stimulated urban and social integration. It gives pedestrians and cyclist an opportunity for easier mobility.

Network and scales: The high-speed network is operated by Renfe, the Spanish national railway company, and connects Logroño with Madrid, Barcelona en Bilbao. The station is next to the national network, and also connects with the regional one.

##### Grand Central Station, New York, United States
Location: New York City, United States

Architect: Reed and Stem; Warren and Wetmore

Development: Between 1899 and 1900, a lot of renovation work was performed on Grand Central Station in New York. But because of a crash in the Park Avenue Tunnel on the north side of the station, a decision to build a new Grand Central Station was taken. This station had to, unlike the old one, fit the growing metropolis. After a competition, two architectural firms won and were chosen to make the new design. Those firms were Reed & Stem and Warren & Wetmore.

Architecture: Reed & Stem and Warren & Wetmore agreed to work together under the name of Associated Architects of Grand Central Terminal. The overall design was the responsibility of Reed & Stem, Warren & Wetmore made sure architectural details were included in the design.

Under the ground, there are two levels of train tracks and platforms. On the higher level, the main trains arrive, and at the lower level, the suburban trains stop. Because all the train tracks are underground, there is space to develop real estate above. The construction of the building is strong enough to carry a tower that still can be built.

Network and scales: Grand Central Station has 44 platforms and 67 train tracks and is in that way connected to the regional and national network, as well as the New York subway. Grand Central Station is the biggest terminus station in the world.

#### Station Domains

##### The Station
There are many different kinds of stations, but what they all have in common is that they are a place of coming and going - a link between the train ride and the environment. This chapter shows that the station is more than a technical and functional building. It is a public space where the traveller’s experience is a focus point.

We can divide the station into different domains, each of which has a separate but interconnected purpose, and signs that create clarity for the travellers and give them the information, orientation and facilities needed.  

![domains](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/ab48fe2e25159fb01848caea59a8bc5e/asset-v1:DelftX+RAIL101x+3T2018+type@asset+block/Domeinen.png)

The different train station domains (image by TUDelft)

##### Environmental domain
The environmental domain ensures that the departing passengers can easily and safely find the station and that the arriving passengers are provided with facilities to continue their journey. The setup for this domain is based on pedestrians, with clear transitions and signs to other kinds of transportation, such as parking lots, the kiss-and-ride, the metro station.
Entrance domain
The entrance domain is where the passengers come inside the station and prepare their journey. It is possible to find information about arriving and departing trains (for instance on overhead screens) and to buy train tickets (from ticket machines or counters).

##### Travel domain
The travel domain is all about moving easily and efficiently to and from the train. It is also possible to get information about the timetable here, for instance. Aside from that, it needs to give the passenger peace of mind (by creating space) to depart and transfer to another train or give comfortable options, like seats, when the passenger has to wait for a short time.
Accommodation domain
The accommodation domain is mostly part of the bigger train stations or terminals in a country. Transfer time is often seen as a waste of time by passengers. This domain offers a solution by offering different kind of facilities, such as retail, catering and services to improve the comfort of waiting.
An example of an unusual service in the accommodation domain is the 'Station Library' in Haarlem, The Netherlands. This started as a two-year trial, to make commuters enthusiastic about going to a library in an easily accessible way. Nowadays, the library has an up-to-date collection of books, a fast service and a broader network to pick up and return books at more stations

Not only travellers are attracted by these facilities and services, the accommodation domain also invites all types of visitors.

#### Wayfinding

Getting lost in an unknown environment can be a stressful experience. Organisations must facilitate wayfinding for their customers in order to prevent them from having negative feelings. If they get lost in a station, the "must" traveller might be late for her appointment, while the "lust" traveller might spend too much time searching for the right way, instead of relaxing.

There are multiple ways to help travellers navigate through a station:

1. Signage: You can use clarifying signs, which show the different facilities and directions. These signs need to be understandable for all types of travellers, native, foreign and differently-abled.

2. Station Layout: The station layout has a huge influence on the wayfinding, even though it is less obvious. The complexity of a building needs to be low enough, so the travellers can absorb all the information around them, and give them a clear overview of the environment. Main paths (often delineated through floor colouring or lighting) and the visibility of orientation spots (for example the entrance, escalators) within the station can help the traveller navigate the overview (Werner & Long, 2003). Aside from this, differentiation is important, to distinguish the spaces from each other. By working with the four different domains, it will be easier for the traveller to figure out where he/she is.

The Hague Central Station
The following example shows The Hague Central Station and its different station domains including corresponding signs. The station has four floors, but this example will only show two of them.

The Hague Central station is an easy-to-read building, where multiple public transportation networks converge. The station building includes all modes of transportation: train, tram and bus. Inside, the trams ride along an elevated track above the train tracks. Retail and hospitality areas can be taken in at a glance. Nowadays, about 190 000 travellers and passers-by make use of The Hague Central Station, but this renovated building was built to host double this amount, in order to fulfil the needs for the coming decade. To facilitate this huge number of travellers, they designed a natural and flexible organisation of traffic flows. Multiple routes are possible, in order to let the traveller create their own route in an easy and clear way.

#### Crowd Sensing

##### Crowd Management
After developing a good wayfinding system in a train station, it is necessary to track and predict the pedestrian flow. When you have the right data and findings, you can improve the ease and speed of walking through the station. This will directly increase the customer satisfaction, but maybe, more importantly, will increase the safety in the station as well. 

First, the pedestrian flow needs to be monitored in order to get a good overview of what is happening. This can be done by different kind of sensors/tools, such as cameras, wifi-spots, Bluetooth or location trackers. This data collection will include the number of visitors, densities and walking speed. When there is a big event going on and they expect a big crowd, they even check social media sources to know who the visitors are and what they are talking about (see the flowchart below). With this information, they can determine the level of service they want to provide to the travellers and the potentially dangerous situations that might occur. 

When the right data is gathered about the pedestrian flow, predictions and decisions can be made to develop the train station. The following golden rules provide solutions of where to act and when improving the crowd management with the data. 

1. Increase throughput at pinch points in the design.
2. Prevent blockades by separating flows in different directions.
3. Distribute traffic over available infrastructure by means of guidance or information provision
4. Limit the inflow (gating) ensuring that the number of pedestrians stays below the critical value.

The videos (below) show how to solve major crowd management problems. One is a train station in Santiago, where the daily pedestrian flow caused difficulties when moving out of the station. This was solved by separating the flows in different directions (direction 2). The other video shows the improvements of information provision during emergencies in a train station in Barcelona (direction 3).

#### Fun fact or good story?

Each week we have hidden a story related to the main topic discussed. Do you have any other fun facts affiliated with People and the Railway Network? Share your knowledge on the forum below.

One station, four continents
Did you know Flinders Street Station in Melbourne, Australia and the Luz Station in Sao Paulo, South America have a surprising number of similarities, being 13100 km apart, but both established by the English, Europe. You also might recognise some of the East-Indian inspired design in Melbourne. This is most likely due to the fact that the original plan was to use the drawings for Melbourne's most famous station for another project in Mumbai, Asia. The story goes that the shipments were wrongly labelled and two stations were fully constructed at the wrong locations.
