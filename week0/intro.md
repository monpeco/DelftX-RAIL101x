#### Track, Train and Movement

An infrastructural network connecting you with the rest of the world. To keep this all running, we first have to get it in motion. For this, we need a track, train and power source.

Thus in week 1, we introduce different train types (from light-rail to high-speed) and tracks and have a close look at the small contact areas where both come together: wheel/rail interface and pantograph/catenary interaction. 

---

#### People and the Railway Network

Railways connect us on a local, national and international scale and, like airplanes, while they may cover a large part of your journey, they rarely take you directly to your final destination.

In week 2, we will take a closer look at the different forms of transport connecting the railway network to transport that takes you from door-to-door. We will discuss the design and structure of railway stations, the people flow within and around them, and the value of a large station to the city on a social, demographical, economical and architectural level.  We will also look at examples of how railways influence the urban scale and sometimes even form barriers dividing a city. Trains can also cause nuisances for the surrounding areas by means of noise and vibration. This and other aspects will be explained to get a better sense of the positive and negative effects of train travelling. 

During this week, we also introduce our interactive railway game for you to experience some of these challenges for yourself. 

---

#### Real Time Traffic Control

If your train was the only one, life would be so much simpler. It could leave at the desired time and take you directly to your preferred destination. There would only have to be one track, one platform, no switches and (most likely) no delay. But, when millions start using the railway network, it becomes rather complex. Passengers expect to be able to travel at any time to any place, and unfortunately, both trains and the infrastructure have limited capacity.

We have local trains, interstate trains, high-speed trains and freight trains, which are all connected somehow. Strategic and robust timetabling is essential to ensure comfort, reliability and safety. If something unforeseen happens, people have to be able to adjust at the moment, keeping the inconvenience to a minimum. The challenge is not to make the perfect timetable on paper, but the one that is adaptable to the unexpected challenges that can happen at any moment.

---

#### Complexity of Disruptions

The appearance of any undesired event is perceived as a disruption in the railway system. Extreme weather circumstances, failing technology (like a broken switch) or human interference (like someone walking on the track or a train driver who overslept) they all can be the reason for a delay. There is a wide range of causes, which all have different effects on the system.

During week 4, we will have a look at the most common causes and some of the more rare ones, and we will analyse how to deal with them. To prevent or reduce the number of disruptions, preventive maintenance and strategies are planned by the railway operator and other parties involved. Nonetheless, even with preventive measures, some disruptions will occur due to external factors. Once a disruption has occurred, it must be resolved. The resolution of the issue should come after evaluating its cause and effect, the significance of the overall operation of the system, or whether it poses a risk in any way.

---

#### Monitoring and Maintenance

In Week 5, we examine a variety of monitoring and maintenance strategies and techniques, including Structural Health Monitoring (SHM).

There is a large step to go from a measurement technique to a monitoring system. Designing a monitoring system comes with many challenges, and will be different for every case, depending on the system to be monitored, the environment and the required information. The crucial step in monitoring is the interpretation of data. In the ideal case, a monitoring system allows you to determine whether a system is damaged, where the damage is located, what type of damage is present, the extent of the damage and the expected remaining lifespan. In this week, we will examine all of these factors.

In addition, we ask you to consider the hazards and legal implications of failing to do so, by examining a few notable cases like the Hatfield Train Disaster.

---

#### Special and Future Systems

After analysing the railway challenges of today and developments of tomorrow, we will take a peek into future further away and some non-conventual tracks used around the world. Where the principle of trains has been similar for over 200 years, a valid question would be: will it stay this way?

That is what we will be exploring in our final week.

#### Learning Objectives

We hope you will enjoy taking this journey on railway engineering with us during the next 6 weeks. Through the use of tools like the game and the worldmap, we hope you will find this an active, interactive and enjoyable learning experience, in which you'll:

Week 1| Name the main railway network components; understand the function of each and the pantograph/catenary interaction between track and train; and compare the density and history of the rail networks around the world.
Week 2| Understand the influence that railways exert on their environment and vice versa; apply your knowledge of demand to build and operate a rail network in the game; evaluate the role of a single station using a real-world case; and examine international examples of the value of stations for the user-experience.
Week 3| Understand the different ways of train control and their effect on timetabling and safety; apply your knowledge of real-time traffic management to handle events in the game; apply the principles of adaptive timetabling to handle a real-world case.
Week 4| Examine the effects and the internal and external factors of disturbances on railway operations, evaluate cases and propose possible preventions and resolutions.
Week 5| Evaluate the different methods of dealing with system degradation and the effects of interaction between the components; apply your understanding of monitoring and maintenance in both a real-world case study and in the game this week.
Week 6| Examine state of the art and future developments of railway systems.

#### Interactive World Map

Starting in week 1:
One great feature of this MOOC is the interactive world map. This is where you can add data and imagery on your local and national railway network and share and compare this with other countries and cities in the world. New data provided will become visible the following Week.

With enrolments from over 100 countries, this world map becomes a unique place where you can get details on trains, tracks, stations, operations and more from all around the world.

Each week the map will appear in one of the discussed topics. The first time you will be asked to register (on the right) with your email address, country and city. If you let your computer remember your details, it should automatically log you in the following week, but please remember your password just in case.

Everyone will be asked to answer several questions regarding their national railway network and, if applicable, their local metro network (later in the course). Input will be shown on the map, after which it can be compared to other countries. Select a country of your choice to learn about this specific network or activate one of the filters to get an overview of the full world.

If your country is too small to be visible on the map, please use the search option on the top right (below the assignment button).

The weekly questions can be found under assignments in the top right menu. If you come across a question which includes uploading an image, please choose one with a maximum size of 1MB. You can either make the photo yourself or pick one from the internet, but if you do use material from someone else we kindly ask you to include the source of recognition.

NB. You get points for interactions on the World map!

If you are not able to submit questions, please delete your browsing history for one day (24 hours).

We know that in traditional classrooms, being asked to contribute to a discussion is often an incentive to continue, so you will get points for every engagement in the World map. After you have submitted, go back to the EdX World map assignment page, scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the button: “Mark as complete” (the image below indicates what you should look for):  

NB. Each week contains multiple questions which require some research. However, this should be a fun, crowdsourcing activity, and should not take more than 20 minutes of research to answer a whole section! You are welcome to put a lot more time an effort in, but it is not expected of you.

We understand that not all countries will have easily accessible data, so if you are really unable to answer a question after browsing - please don't leave the course - rather indicate below "I completed the questions I was able to research".

In addition, crowdsourcing from multiple references may mean that we get slightly different results depending on the year sourced (for instance: different Wikipedia articles say the Netherlands has "397 stations", "404 stations" and "around 400 stations". While the latest data from our railway company confirms it is 404 stations, "around 400" is sufficient. Moreover, our world map will reflect the average response for each country). We do strongly encourage you to reference sources younger than 2010, where possible. 

Trouble Navigating the world map?
Most of the functions of this world map speak for themselves when you go through the different weeks. But, if you do come across bugs or issues, please use the forum 'World Map Help' below. Click on Show Discussion, and see if someone else has already posted the same comment or question. If they have, please vote for their posts (a button on the right). If not, post your new comment by adding a post or by replying to the main thread.

Enjoy!

#### Railway Strategy Game

Starting in week 2:
For this course, we have developed a serious game with weekly challenges. This game will guide you through the process of decision-making while building your own rail network, operating it and keeping it maintained.

Welcome to The Land of Anticipation, Timed Tactics And Gruelling Abstruseness - ATTAGA

Attaga is a country with 40 cities and villages and their happiness depends on you.

Cities have to be connected in an ever-changing setting, and you will need to deal with wear, capacity, developments and disturbances. The performance of your railway system over time is based on choices and priorities made and set by you as the player, within an increasingly complex situation.

Communities come in five sizes; 200, 500, 1000, 2500 and 5000 people and can grow over time. Above 500 inhabitants, communities need to be connected to the railway network, whereas villages of 200 won't affect your score in a negative way (but watch out for population growth over time!) 

#### Goals
The main goal of the game is to have a high percentage of customer satisfaction over time. This is based on the average customer satisfaction measured continuously while playing. The current value is visible at the bottom of the screen, next to the overall percentage, and is influenced by four main factors: 

Customers served: Does your network meets the demand of the different cities?
Comfort: Can people travel directly or do they have to switch lines?
Travel time: How close can you get to the fastest possible connection?
Reliability: How often do lines break down and how fast are they fixed?

##### The Game Menu and Controls

As a user, you can create new connections between cities using local and interstate trains, create high-speed connections between your larger cities and connect the rail network to foreign countries. In hilly areas only mountain trains can be used. The main menu consists of six main tabs, with two important actions within 'cities' and 'tracks'.

Missions: Find your next mission and see what you have accomplished so far. Financial rewards give you possibilities to develop your network faster.
Events: Get updates on city growth, track status and local weather circumstances. Where did a track break down and which area needs your attention?
Cities: Oversee all cities and villages on the map with local properties to make correct decisions and set priorities and check if there is a passing station.
>> Connect: Once you click on a specific city, this button appears. Use it to create a new connection or extend an existing line from a selected city, choosing a type of track, train frequency and a number of switches.
Tracks: Get a list of all your tracks and check their fail rate. Use monitoring trains to get more detailed information on the status of your tracks.
>> Maintain: In the tracklist, you have this button. Use it to direct your crews to maintain or repair tracks. Be aware that this costs time and you only have three crews at your disposal.
Lines: Find all created lines with start and end station. Update the frequency to meet the changing demand, as more people start using your network.
Control: Gain knowledge on your track status by buying and updating a monitoring train and upgrade your control system for higher train frequency.

You can see the menu on the right of game, as shown in this screenshot:

#### Good to know

- Within the game you generate money by serving customers (tickets) and by accomplishing missions.
- Red dots in the menu indicate either the occurrence of a new event or the successful mission.
- Building, maintaining and repairing tracks costs time, resulting in temporarily unavailable crews.
- Small/large bridges/tunnels, national parks, length, type of train/track and frequency increase costs.
- Fail rate is an indication of wear and tear; tracks can always break down due to external factors.
- Repairing after a track breaks down costs three times as much compared to maintaining it in time.
- Interstate trains can pass local trains at smaller stations using the same line.

#### Colouring of the tracks

White: In service
Red: Closed
Orange: In service, but too little capacity
Grey: Being maintained or repaired
Green: Being built
Blue: Selected line to extend

#### Fun fact or good story?

Each week we have hidden an unusual story related to the main topic discussed, called 'fun fact or good story'.

To introduce this topic, we have summed up a few interesting things on railways that you probably did not know yet:

* The modern age of trains begun in early 1800s, after the initial patent of James Watt for stationary steam engine expired;
* The railroad connecting United States' East and West coast shortened travel between New York and California from weeks and months to only a few days in 1866;
* Abraham Lincoln's assassination helped to publicize train travel. The funeral train was front-page news as a luxurious way of travelling;
* 100 years ago, the United States had 100,000 miles more rail track compared to today. At the time, it was enough to reach the moon from earth;
* Indian Railways has over 1.6 million employees, making it one of the world's ten largest employers.

The weekly topic will focus on only one fact or story with more details and background information based on that specific week's content.
