#### Week 1: Introduction

#### Introducing Track, Train and Movement

This week, we get moving, by introducing different train types and tracks and have a close look at the small contact areas where both come together: wheel/rail interface and pantograph/catenary interaction.

While waiting on a station's platform, you might see different types of trains passing by: regular passenger trains, freight trains with sometimes strange looking wagons, high speed trains and, when connected to a light rail network, tram, metro or even mono-rail.

Where some train-types can share the same track, there are different ways to set-up this infrastructure to meet specific demands. Parts of this week's content might already seem familiar, but we will take these first few hours to ease into the topic, which builds up over the coming weeks. 

In terms of assignments, you can expect two short quizzes and an interactive world map (crowdsourcing) assignment. 

##### Are you an expert in the field?

That's great! This MOOC introduces different aspects of the railway network, but if you want to go into more detail, you may be interested in our follow-up online professional education courses (Operations Course starting in September 2018).

#### A Tangible Railway Network

You are probably familiar with a specific railway network. At least, we are pretty sure that you are familiar with trains and track. Nevertheless, we think that it's advantageous to align our understanding of the railways. Therefore we start this module with an overview of the main parts of railway networks.

- **track**: In traditional designs the rails of the track are supported by wooden or concrete beams,
called **sleepers**, which in turn rest on the ballast bed
- **ballast bed**: crushed stone where the rail rest.

*There are also track structures without ballast. The most typical one is a slab track, where the ballast bed is replaced by a concrete plate or slab.*

- Traditionally rails are joined using metal **fishplates** and have a small gap between the rails.
The gap gives the rails a possibility for expansion during hot weather.
The gaps also introduce rail discontinuity, which is one of the main sources of track damage.
Therefore, in modern tracks, the rails are continuously welded,
which eliminates the gap and the rail discontinuity.

- In a railway vehicle the car body is supported by two **bogies**.
- Each bogie has two wheelsets which are rigidly connected to an axle. All these elements are connected to each other by suspensions.

- Other familiar components of the railway network are **stations and yards**.
- Trains carry passengers from station to station where they can transfer to other means of transportation.
- **Yards** are arrangements of sidings used to store trains.

- Signals are a common system for controlling train movements. In general, they indicate whether a train may enter the section of track beyond the signal.

- **Turnouts**, also called **switches**, are the components of a railway network that guide trains from one track to another.

- The main parts of a turnout are the **switch panel** and the **crossing panel**.

- In the switching part a pair of movable rails called **blades**, or points, can be shifted, which provides the switching possibilities.

- In the crossing panel the two tracks intersect at one level. The rails are disconnected in the intersection point, enabling the wheel of the train to pass the two crossed rails. To bridge this gap, wing rails are mounted on each side of the intersecting portion of the two running rails.

- **Level crossings** are intersections where a railway line crosses a road or path at the same level. In order to provide "passive" protection, various types of warning signs can be placed in front of the crossing. The use of automatic warning devices such as flashing lights, warning tones and boom gates are called "active" protection.

- Railway lines may also cross over or under roads and rivers using bridges, aqueducts or tunnels. the rails are usually directly fastened to the bridge deck. Guard rails are placed along areas of restricted clearance. These rails keep the wheels of the train in alignment in case of derailment. This way damage to the struture is minimized.

#### Real-life examples

Here are a few real-life examples of railway network features that were mentioned in the video.

**Bogies**

![Bogie](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/ffe725d6e5a0034760488bf09083ff6c/asset-v1:DelftX+RAIL101x+3T2018+type@asset+block/bogie.jpg)

A train bogie (image by PetrS.)

This is the part of the railway vehicle that provides steering and absorbs the shocks originated 
in the wheel-rail interface. It consists of wheel sets connected to the bogie frame via vertical, 
lateral and longitudinal suspensions. Usually, one bogie has two wheel sets and a railway vehicle 
has 2 bogies.

**Train yard**

![Yard](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/71d87630f2a72ccdeb474d0857d61f43/asset-v1:DelftX+RAIL101x+3T2018+type@asset+block/trainyard.jpg)

A trainyard is a place dedicated to maintaining, storing, sorting or loading/unloading of trains, 
metros or trams. Train yards consist of a series of parallel tracks, wherein rolling stock can be 
stored off the mainline, without obstructing the flow of traffic. Railway vehicles are moved around 
the rail yard using a special type of locomotive, called a yard switcher, or in some cases by the 
'smart' use of gravity controlled systems (see the video below). Vehicles in a train yard can be 
sorted by numerous categories, such as by railroad company, loaded or unloaded, destination, car 
type, or whether they need repairs. Train yards are usually built where there is a need to store 
cars, while they are not being loaded or unloaded, or are waiting to be assembled into trains, 
like in harbours (as seen in the picture).


**Turnout (also called a switch)**

![Switch](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/3a892df5ee6c20af1f6ab005bbe69e21/asset-v1:DelftX+RAIL101x+3T2018+type@asset+block/frog_large.jpg)


A railway turnout (image by TU Delft)

Turnouts (also called switches, points, or S&C - switches and crossings) are the components of a railway 
network that guide trains from one track to another. A turnout is comprised of switch and crossing panels, 
connected by a closure panel. A switch panel is the section of a turnout used to alter the direction of 
motion of passing trains. This panel consists of two switch rails, two stock rails, and switching machines 
(or point machines).

In the crossing panel, the two tracks intersect at one level, in which the running rails disconnect at 
the intersection point to enable the wheel of the train to pass the two crossed rails. This intersecting 
portion is the so-called nose rail, or crossing nose. Trains approaching from the narrow end of the nose 
rail (the nose point) towards the running rail performing facing movements; trailing movements follow 
the opposite path.


**Guard rail**


![Guard_rail](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/da4d54e8c2dce866a23384fde844ba18/asset-v1:DelftX+RAIL101x+3T2018+type@asset+block/guardrail.jpg)

Guard rail (image by TU Delft)

Guard rails are used in railways to guide wheels through possible catch points or points of possible 
derailment, like on turnouts or on very sharp curves. On bridges, the guard rails are installed to 
prevent damage to the bridge in case of a derailment. The wheels will be guided in such a way that 
the train will stay on the bridge.

#### Track Types


In the following section, we expand on the different railway tracks that exist around the world. Given the existence of so many differences in tracks, we first introduce you into some basic track types. 

##### Ballasted Track

Almost all existing railways are of the ballasted track type. In this case the track system, consisting of sleepers and rails, are placed on a layer of granular material known as ballast. In the image below, you see a cross-section of a ballasted track.

![This picture shows a cross-section of a ballasted track](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/90acb67f9e285511b1eb160a90266636/asset-v1:DelftX+RAIL101x+3T2018+type@asset+block/ballast.jpg)

##### Slab Track

In case of slab track, the ballast material is replaced by a concrete slab that serves as a 
support for the track. Usually the sleepers are integrated in the concrete slab as well. The 
rails are mounted with the same type of fasteners as used for ballasted track.

![This picture shows a cross-section of a slab track](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/5b6bad3d1fcab6ddc93211373b838fe5/asset-v1:DelftX+RAIL101x+3T2018+type@asset+block/slabtrack.jpg)

##### Embedded track

These tracks are embedded in the road and are being used by trams and lightrail and for 
levelcrossings. The unique feature about this kind of track is that it can share the road 
with other types of traffic, like cars and buses. The track itself can be either ballasted or 
slabtrack. In case of slabtrack the rails are sometimes embedded in an elastic material that 
replaces the fasteners. This latter type of embedded track can also be used for mainlines as 
a low-maintenance track system. 

![This picture shows an embedded track](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/bc1b4b36ebb82bfcf0f72f789224b70d/asset-v1:DelftX+RAIL101x+3T2018+type@asset+block/embedded.jpg)

##### Magnetic Levitated Trains

Magnetic Levitated (MagLev) trains are based on a completely different principle. As the train 
is carried by magnets, instead of wheels, the track acts merely as a guideway, hosting the magnets 
required for train levitation. In module 6, we will discuss MagLev trains more in depth.

#### Track Properties


Until now, we merely focused on the external appearance of tracks. The appearances are governed 
by a number of rules and guidelines that are discussed on this page. Respectively, the influence 
of track loads, track gauge, speed limits and clearances are discussed.


##### Track Loads

The design of the track structure determines the weight of a train that is allowed on that 
track. Track loading is expressed in axle loads. Axle load is the total weight of a train 
divided by the number of axles of that train. For convenience, axle loads are measured in 
metric tons. Most tracks allow a maximum axle load of 22.5t.  However, on US freight tracks, 
sometimes even 35t axle load is permitted.

Tonnage is another measure of track loading. Basically, daily tonnage is the summed weight 
of all trains that pass a certain track on a day. So tonnage measures the intensity of 
railway traffic.

##### Track Gauge

The rails of a railway track are spaced on a certain distance. Railway vehicles can only 
drive on tracks with a corresponding width. This width is know as the track gauge. For 
historical reasons, many different track gauges exist. See the figure below for all 
different gauges. As shown in this figure, the track gauge is measured between the inner 
sides of the rails, and exactly 14mm below the top of the rail.

One special track gauge is known as the standard gauge. Originally, this gauge is defined in imperial measures as 4ft and 8½in. In metric units, the standard gauge is 1435mm wide. From the figure below, it is clear that the standard gauge (light blue) is the most widespread track gauge.

![This picture shows a world map that shows in which country which gauge is used]()

#### Track Limitations

##### Speed Limits

Every rail track has a speed limit. The speed limit is the maximum velocity that a train is allowed 
to drive on that track. The speed limit is influenced by a number of parameters.
•Track condition. The geometry of the track determines passenger comfort. The presence of e.g. switches, overpasses or gradients may influence the passenger comfort negatively. This often has to do with the maintenance status of the track.
•Signalling. The type of signalling applied on a track is also a factor in determining the speed limit. When train speed increases, it becomes more difficult to read signals in a safe way.
•Curves. Passing a curve with a velocity higher than allowed results in passenger discomfort and shifting freight or, even worse, in derailment or vehicle overturning. The radius of curves in the track therefore limits the train speed.

The highest commercial speed limit for maglev trains it is set around 430km/h and for normal trains, 
it is currently set at 320km/h. The world speed record is almost twice as high. On 21 April 2015, 
the Japanese magnetically-levitated Shinkansen L0 train reached a speed of 603 km/h during trials. 
The speed record for trains on conventional track is set by a French TGV train at 574.8km/h. 

Here are two links to YouTube video's showing the speed records.
•Shinkansen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_sHahhDWU4
•TGV: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWbmRA5JIi0 (you can see the speed in the upper left corner, next to "Vitesse")

Clearances

It's self-evident for railways that the train and the track have to fit together. We already touched 
on this topic by discussing the track gauge, where the distance between both rails has to match the 
distance between the wheels. In practice, many more installations reside besides the tracks, for 
instance platforms on stations, signals aside the track or tunnels. In contrary to the wheel and the 
rails, the train should not touch these devices. Therefore clearances are designed.

![Clearances](https://prod-edxapp.edx-cdn.org/assets/courseware/v1/a7fb98d6a9c2ac8e03419b788a55d3c4/asset-v1:DelftX+RAIL101x+3T2018+type@asset+block/Clearances.png)

Clearances of a train on straight and curved track (Source: TU Delft)

These consist of three parts, namely the structure gauge (also known as the normal clearance), the 
vehicle gauge and the loading gauge. The structure gauge describes the area in which no installations 
may be installed, while the vehicle gauge describes the maximum sizes for a vehicle. The vehicle gauge 
will always be smaller than the structure gauge to allow for movements of the train such as hunting 
(this will be discussed in week 1.5). Most often the loading gauge is defined slightly smaller than 
the vehicle gauge for safety reasons. The clearances can differ depending on whether a track is 
straight or curved. Besides that, clearances can differ per country of region.

#### Track Components


In this unit, we have a deeper look at the track structure. Below, a cross-section image of a typical 
railway track is depicted. By hovering over the different elements, an explanation is given about that 
element. By clicking on the grey bars and i-buttons, more in-depth information can be found. Please 
explore the image below to learn about the many components that make up a railway track.

Rail Pads

When using concrete sleepers rail pads are used underneath the rails. These small 10x10cm rubber tiles 
are rather important, since they protect the underlying sleeper creating a smooth transition between 
steel and concrete and processing the immense forces between track and train. Without rail pads all 
concrete sleepers would break when just a single train passes. Below you can see several pads found 
when maintaining tracks and in some cases they have almost vanished, showing the pressure on the rail 
and the essential role they have.

#### Scenic train tracks

1. Tanggula Pass (Tibet)



With a maximum altitude of 5070 meters above sea level, this train track in Tibet is the highest train track in the 
world. It also has an average altitude of 4500 meter above sea level and it lays at 4000 meter above sea level for at 
least 960 kilometers long. Because of the high altitude a few constructive difficulties appear like the lack of oxygen 
and extreme temperatures. Passengers in the trains are accommodated with extra oxygen during certain parts of the journey.





2. Tren a las Nubes (Argentina)

This picture shows the Tren a Las Nubes


Literally translated it says, train to the clouds, and its name is somewhat logical since it will reach an elevation of 
4220 meters above sea level, which is the height at which the Polvorilla viaduct is located. This train track also 
contains two zigzags to climb up the slope of the mountain by driving back and forth. In addition this train track 
contains 29 bridges, 21 tunnels, thirteen viaducts and two spirals. The start point of this train is at Salta station, 
the whole track takes 15 hours to drive and is 434 kilometer long.



3. Trans-Siberian Railway (Russia)

This picture shows the Trans-Siberian Railway

Spanning from Moscow to Vladivostok the Trans-Siberian Railway (TSR) is one of the largest railway networks. It was built 
between 1891 and 1916 and has a length of about 9290 kilometers. It covers eight time zones and is the longest railway 
line in the world.

 


4. The Landwasser Viaduct (Switzerland)

This picture shows the Landwasser Viaduct

Switzerland has large areas of land that are mountainous. When building railways through this, the railway engineers had to 
be extremely innovative, imaginative and courageous to build a complex and efficient mountain railway system. One of the most 
impressive feats was the building of the Landwasser Viaduct which carries a (narrow gauge) railway track. When approaching 
the viaduct the train travels through the Landwasser tunnel. The engineers had to build the viaduct starting at the end of 
the tunnel. The construction of the viaduct is impressive for two reasons, all materials (limestone!) had to be transported 
to this remote site before construction could begin and the height of the arches meant that traditional building techniques 
could not be used and completely new techniques had to be developed.


5. Georgetown Loop Railroad (USA)

This picture shows a loop in the Georgetown Railroad

The Georgetown Loop Railroad was one of Colorado's first visitor attractions. Completed in 1884, this spectacular stretch 
of three-foot narrow gauge railroad was considered an engineering marvel for its time. It includes three hairpin turns, four 
bridges and a 30-degree horseshoe curve from Georgetown to Silver Plume. The Colorado & Southern Railway operated the line 
for passengers and freight from 1899 to 1938, when it was abandoned.

In 1973, the Colorado Historical Society began restoring the railroad as part of its 978-acre Georgetown Loop Historic Mining 
& Railroad Park. A replica of the High Bridge was completed in 1984, in time to celebrate the 100th anniversary of its 
original construction.


6. The Death Railway (Thailand)

This picture shows the bridge over the river Kwai

The Death Railway (also known as the Burma Railway, Burma-Siam Railway, Thailand-Burma Railway and similar names), was a 415
kilometres long railway built by the Empire of Japan in 1943, to support its forces in the Burma campaign of World War II. 
The line was closed in 1947, but the section between Nong Pla Duk and Nam Tok was reopened ten years later. The name of the 
railway comes from the deaths that happened during the construction. The estimated total number of civilian labourers and 
prisoners of war who died during construction varies considerably, but the Australian Government figures suggest that of the 
330,000 people that worked on the line about 106,000 people died.

#### Heavy Rail


Why are you able to see straight through the modern multiple units from front to back, while in the older ones you can't? What enables this?

Heavy rail is a term for regular trains and infrastructure. In this MOOC, we will use this term to introduce passenger transport trains as well as heterogeneous transport. The structure and design of passenger trains has changed quite a lot over the years. One very recognisable one is that in the past a train consisted of a clearly recognisable locomotive and several cars (or coaches), which were connected by transit locks (vestibuled). Modern trains feel more open, and more often, you can actually see through the train from end-to-end. This makes it much more spacious and it comes with a feeling of safety, but an important additional advantage is that this limits the damage to the track. 

To make this possible, the wheel-sets had to be repositioned. At first, each car/wagon had a bogie on both sides, making them independent in use, but - when connected - the result is two bogies very close to each other. When making a turn or when passing a switch, this created a notable difference in where the end of each car would be. This affected, not only the relative position of both cars, but also the space needed to make this happen. A much larger additional space resulted in the rubber tubes (transit locks) acting as a buffer between different cars. In the new situation, a shared bogie connects two cars, enabling them to be placed much closer together. Individual cars are usually slightly shortened by using this combined solution, but the full train still uses fewer bogies compared to the old situation. As an additional advantage, this saves weight and limits maintenance.


##### Heterogeneous train traffic

If local and interstate trains are combined on the same infrastructure (sometimes even with freight and/or high speed trains), we call this heterogenous train traffic. Multiple types of trains using the same track saves space and development costs, but also brings additional challenges. Forces on the track are different for each type, creating more wear and tear to the material (more on this in week 5). In addition, combining local trains, interstate trains and even freight trains, complicates timetabling. Apart from the operational challenges and increased track damage, it creates wide diversity on the track.


In the Netherlands, we have a dense network in which interstate trains travel between the larger cities and local trains stop at each station using the same tracks. On average, every ten minutes, a train runs by in each direction, leaving very limited space to fit in freight transport and high speed. This is why important international connections have their own infrastructure, which creates independent timetabling, as well as a track, which is specially designed for the specific type of train. Not only is this much faster and minimises damage, but it also is much more reliable.

Apart from external factors, most issues within the railway network originate from switches. With a separate track for each train (type), the need for switches is much lower, thus giving a lower chance of problems.

The most reliable way to run trains is either in separate lines (like metro) or in circles. People might need to switch trains more often, but when the reliability increases, many people won't mind. Using only one type of train on specific tracks enables a much denser schedule and less damage to the infrastructure. In case something happens on one of the lines, it will not interfere with the scheduled trains on other lines. We will take a closer look at this unbundling of different trains for different purposes/distances in week 2 and 3.

##### Multiple units

Especially on rail networks used a lot for commuter traffic, traditional trains with locomotive and towed cars are considered not flexible enough. On these tracks, most of the time, Multiple Unit (MU) passenger trains are utilised. MU's consist of two or more passenger cars, and have a driver cabin at both ends. MU's don't have a dedicated locomotive, but have one or multiple motorized bogies  which power the train. This can be both from diesel or electric engines.

The big advantage of MU's is that during peak hours, multiple MU's can be combined into a single train driven by a single train driver at the head (front) of the train. The single driver controls the engines and breaks of all the MU's combined. There are a few cases in which MU's, once coupled, even allow passengers to walk from one MU to the other.

#### Train components

Why does a freight train often get priority over passenger transport if using the same network?

Many have experienced it at least once in their lives. While waiting for a railway crossing, a freight train passes by. This can take quite long, even minutes, since you can regularly count over a hundred cars passing by, and often at a limited speed. Not only can freight trains be multiple kilometers (or miles) long, they also carry all kinds of different goods, demanding different kinds of car type designs, which can create rather unexpected combinations.


Each type of car design has its own characteristics and features. Worldwide, many more types and spin-off designs of freight cars exists on the railway tracks, often in bright recognisable colours. Some of them even devoted to very special tasks, like the Schnabel cars, which are specially designed to carry really heavy or oversized loads, like electric transformers. The car consists of two beams, in which the load is suspended, supported on the track with a lot of wheels or bogies. This way, the load is part of the structure of the car. Using this many wheels allows for the heavy weight to be transported, and suspending the load allows the car to use normal track curves.

To move hundreds of freight cars, locomotives often are much heavier and stronger compared to passenger trains. The strongest locomotives currently available have over 19000 horsepower (comparable to approximately 19 Bugatti Veyrons!). Aside from normal locomotives for freight transport, special locomotives are often used for the shunting process. Since during shunting, speeds are not as high, but frequent acceleration and deceleration are required, locomotives have been specially designed to handle these kinds of jobs. In some cases, shunting locomotives can even work by remote control, so no extra train driver is needed, while wagons are being pushed rather than pulled.

When assembling a freight train, the most important things to consider are the gross weight of the freight vehicles, the terrain the train has to cover, the speed it has to travel by and the availability of overhead power supply. Both the weight of the train and the maximum incline determine the required traction for the total train. The required brake power is determined based on the weight and maximum decline. Based on these requirements, either one or multiple locomotives can be selected to be used in a train. In some cases, multiple locomotives are spaced out over the full length of the train for a better distribution of power. In the video below, a nice example is seen of a long freight train climbing a relatively steep incline in California, using 3 locomotives.


https://youtu.be/yZCYhP1D4O4

So freight trains can be really long and sometimes use the regular railway network, which makes them interfere with passenger transport. A situation can occur when you have an important meeting or time is running out to catch your connecting train at the next station and you suddenly stop. Minutes go by when nothing happens and then suddenly a freight train passes by. For the people sitting in the train, this incident may seem odd. Why not just let your train pass first?

The length of the freight train actually causes many more problems when it had to wait for you. It covers such a large part of the track that it often blocks multiple switches, railway crossings or even one or more bridges at the same time, which cannot open at that point. Also it might just be leaving a tunnel or entering one, both creating a situation where you really do not want to stop as a train driver. There are multiple examples, where freight trains get stuck in tunnels, since they do not have the power to pull all carriages out after standing still, because of an elevation on either side. Other reasons for this are the extremely long break-distance, the required power to get everything moving again and the time that it takes before the whole combination is back up to speed. For your train, it is much easier to stop for a moment, making sure the freight doesn't interfere with the full timetabling schedule, creating delays for possibly dozens of passenger trains, which could just as well have been yours (or will be) the next time.

While this list of reasons might not help for why you missed the start of your meeting, it most likely helped many others to get in time to theirs.

#### Light Rail

What is the effect of a much lower entrance level on the design of modern trams?

To enable fast short connections within cities, light rail is often used. Light vehicles can accelerate fast and stop quite easy (rapid transit). Subway and tram are examples of this, as well as monorail, which also can be seen as a train type on itself. Light rail vehicles form an intermediate group, driving tram-like vehicles on higher speeds and on a dedicated infrastructure.


If comparing the older and more modern designed tram, the most profound change is the lower entrance level for passengers. Before this, trams always had a little staircase (few steps) to get to the seating area, which was situated above all heavy equipment like transformers, engines, compressors and generators. To improve comfort, this all has been moved to the roof in the new designs. This way people can enter the vehicle on street level.


There are disadvantages: situating the mass higher will create an unbalanced vehicle. Especially within curves (and therewith switches), left to right movement increases a lot which damages the track. Knowing that trams make rather sharp turns emphasises this even more. This almost 'nervous behaviour' makes the flange scrape the rail, causing a large amount of wear with each wheel passing.

More details on the contact and interaction between rail and wheel will be discussed later this week. In the section on wheel/rail interface, we will also look at the problems which occur when putting light rail vehicles on heavy rail infrastructure.



##### Monorail 

Monorail vehicles can also be categorised under light rail, although Monorail almost is a transport type on its own. Monorails use only one instead of two rails, and can roll or (as most people will recognize it) use magnets and levitate over it. In week 6, we will take a close look at how this and other special systems work and where they can be found in the world.

In practice, there are no clear boundaries or numbers that distinguish heavy rail from light rail, when looking at axle loads. The categories are even differently interpreted in different locations around the world. What is most important is that most suitable vehicle types and design for specific purposes, which mainly depends on number of stops. In addition to the weight, important factors and properties are acceleration, speed, the minimum radius of curves, but for example also the number of doors. A higher frequency of stops is often related to the limited time on the platform, which then directly influences the number of doors to facilitate a fast process of exiting and entering the train.

#### High Speed Trains

Why does China invest in high-speed trains rather than in domestic airlines connections?

High speed trains are designed for operational speeds of over 200 km/h. Some are able to reach speeds up to around 400 km/h during commercial operation, and a world record has been set at over 550 km/h during test-phase. In order to achieve these kinds of speeds, both a special infrastructure and special rolling stock are needed. If an electrified high-speed train actually reaches a speed that high, the catenary system (more details in the next section) will need significant repairs after each train that passes. The forces on the pantograph will become higher than it can handle, and it might even break down during the first test. Catenary systems (as they are designed in 2017) are usually able to handle speeds op to 350-400 km/h, when looking at a life-expectancy longer than a year.

Looking at high speed infrastructure compared to regular systems, differences can be found, for example, in the allowable radiuses in track curves. Due to higher speeds, larger radiuses are needed in order to keep the ride comfortable. This results in high speed railways being less able to follow terrain, thus having more bridges and tunnels, increasing costs and making it more difficult to implement within dense areas.

There are also differences in the tolerances for the infrastructure itself, both for the rail and the catenary. Even on a straight track, the rail is never 100% straight. There will always be some margin of error in this track alignment, introduced in building the track, of which the tolerated error is specified. For high speed tracks though, the tolerated error in the track alignment is much smaller. This is because, using the same margins as for normal tracks would increase the risk of derailment in high speed trains. Constructing a track with these smaller margins results in higher construction costs for the track itself, often requiring better foundations, etc.

In railway vehicles, there are also some clear differences between normal and high speed railways. The clearest difference can be found in the aerodynamics. At higher speeds, air resistance goes up quadratically. Doubling the speed would make the power consumption to overcome the air resistance go up by a factor of 8! Reducing air resistance thus becomes extremely important for achieving high speeds. This can be seen in the typical long-nose that most high speed trains have, but also in the integration of the pantograph on the train. Other details you will often find are, for example, putting a cover on the coupling mechanism at the front of the train, minimizing the gap between coaches, and installing side skirts underneath the train. Aside from the aerodynamics, differences can be found in many other aspects of the vehicle as well. You can think about different bogies, power distribution systems, closed toilet circuits (like in airplanes), windows that cannot be opened, and many more.

Over long distances, it might be logical to expect air traffic as main way of transportation, but as mentioned at the start of this section, China chose instead to invest in fast train connections between main cities. The large amount of people, with an increasing demand every year, is the main reason for this decision. Trains can easily carry a thousand passengers at once, whereas planes are often limited to a few hundred and even the largest passenger aircraft will not get to that number. Trains also can run at a much higher frequency and railway stations can be placed much closer to the desired location, often even within the heart of a city or business district. An additional advantage is the limited time to board, since for domestic train travel customs and security delays are limited to a minimum. Apart from all this, trains are reliable, safe and fast, especially in modern designs of both infrastructure and rolling stock and trains are better for the environment as they run on clean energy.

We will discuss special high speed trains further in Week 6.

#### Maintenance Vehicles

Why are road vehicles used to maintain the railway track (using small attached steel wheels) rather than an actual train?

Maintenance and inspection vehicles are an unusual appearance on the track. These special vehicles are designed to repair and/or replace (parts of) the track. They often have a dedicated purpose, such as tamping the ballast, grinding the rail surface or doing a single dedicated type of measurement. Some can even replace the sleepers and ballast bed underneath them, while driving slowly over the track, operating like a complete factory on wheels, like seen in this video (source: Strukton Rail). 


Because it can be very expensive to close down a part of the track, while it is being maintained, it is common that these trains run at night to minimise the impact on the regular schedule.

In some cases when maintenance or measurements have to be arranged quickly, getting a train to the right location might not always be the best solution. Road vehicles often have easier access by not being restricted by train paths. These 'hybrid vehicles' are equipped with an extra set of wheels, which they can deploy in order to be able to run on the rail. Since the capacity is much more limited, compared to full maintenance trains, this solution is used mostly for high priority repairs on specific parts of the track, but with many small disturbances happening each day, hybrid vehicles can be seen rather often. Railway crossings are used to enter or leave the tracks.

#### Fun fact or good story?

In the early part of the twentieth century, a working 22-tonne monorail prototype was developed by Louis Brennan. In 1910, the balancing train was presented to the public carrying 50 passengers, one of which Winston Churchill, at a test speed of 20 mph during the Japan-British exhibition in London.

#### Puffs of Smoke and Steam 

Right, we have trains and we know about locomotives and power cars. But how is a locomotive provided with motive power? And how does this influence the performance of a train? And why is traction so important?

That's what you will discover in this learning unit. We start with a discussion about different types of motive power. You might remember the big steam engines with those impressive clouds of smoke and steam, that's exactly where we start!

---

#### Sources of Motive Power

The first trains were driven by steam power. Coal or oil is burned to heat water to steam, this steam is used to drive the engine. Therefore, a steam locomotive is required to carry water and fuel.

Nowadays, almost all running steam locomotives are used on heritage railways or are working on isolated narrow gauge railways. High maintenance costs, low fuel efficiencies and the need for numerous water supply facilities are the reasons that electric and diesel traction are the preferred means of motive power.

Diesel traction is comparable to steam, as a diesel train also carries its own fuel. Instead of a steam engine, a diesel engine is installed. The diesel engines in a diesel locomotive don't always drive the wheels directly like a diesel engine in an automobile does. Often the diesel engine drives a generator, which produces electricity that is used to drive electric motors on the wheels. These diesel-electric locomotives don't need a gearbox.  Both diesel locomotives and diesel multiple units are in use on railway networks around the world.


Electric traction forms the alternative for diesel traction. Electric trains are equipped with electric motors only. Electric power is obtained from the infrastructure, either by means of a catenary or a third rail system. On current railway networks, both electric locomotives and electric multiple units are in use.

#### Getting Power to the Trains

In electrified railway systems a distribution grid transfers the energy from stationary substations to moving trains. Typically, this is achieved by either a rigid conductor rail at ground level or resilient overhead contact line. For high speed lines (above 80 km/h) there is generally chosen for an overhead contact line system. This is due for safety reasons, because above 1000 Vac and 1500 Vdc it is only allowed to use overhead contact line systems.

##### Catenary System

Almost all designs of overhead contact lines in the world, and all designs in the Netherlands, use a secondary wire that supports the mounting of the contact wire and which forms a catenary shape. From which the name catenary stems from. The whole overhead contact line system is commonly referred to as the catenary system. The system consists of a contact wire, which is in contact with the pantograph. To mount this contact wire as smooth and level as possible use is made of a second wire and droppers in between to connect both wires. This allows for that the contact wire is mounted as smooth as possible. The electrical coupling between the contact wire and the train is achieved using a current collector or pantograph. Reliability of the energy transfer system, including catenary and pantograph, is primarily dependent on the quality of the aforementioned coupling. The electrical coupling is achieved by mechanical contact which relies on the dynamical interaction between pantograph and catenary system.

To enhance a stable energy supply the contact force between catenary and pantograph must be constant and steady. This is hindered by stiffness variations, for example at bridges and tunnels but to a lesser extent also when passing supports. Therefore different configurations of catenary suspension systems have been proposed and are being used, but almost all designs can be grouped into four main types. Except the trolley wire that has a single wire, the others have a messenger wire connected to the contact wire by the use of vertical droppers. The reason for this more sophisticated design is to decrease the variations of stiffness along the length. When the speed of the train increases this becomes more important and thus more sophisticated designs are required, as can be seen in the figure below.

##### Stagger Motion

A lateral stagger motion is applied in all catenary structures in order to evenly wear the contact strips of the pantograph. Differences can be found between the alignment of the messenger and contact wire. They can be mounted parallel to each other, where they both describe a stagger motion or the messenger wire is aligned with the track and only the contact wire follows a stagger motion. In the latter case the wires are in a more horizontal position to each other and hence this system is less prone to lateral deflections due to the wind. The maximum permissible lateral deviation is 0:55m.

##### Pantograph

The pantograph is the device on top of the train that extracts the energy from the catenary system. The pantograph is also referred to as current collector. Where the catenary systems is resilient the pantograph as well. The pantograph pushes gently against the catenary and gentle force that is necessary to lift the device is often established by air pressure. As the pantograph just pushes gently it is critical that all parameters of the pantograph fit the catenary system, because a gentle push also means that the two come loose very easily (which we do not want).

Present day pantograph often look like the one in the picture below. It consists of the lifting device based on air pressure, a frame that is responsible the movement of the contact strips is only in the vertical plane. And the contact strips that are sliding along the catenary. Between the contact strips and the frame are some springs to get just the right and adequate gentle push. To compensate for aerodynamic effect winglets (which can cause that the pantograph wants to lift like an aeroplane and starts to push too hard) are used, so they are essentially upside down aerofoils.


You might wonder where the name pantograph comes from and you might know that a pantograph is a device also used to scale drawings. Actually pantograph refers to the mechanism of linkages. In history the first designers of a pantograph (or current collector) for a train used this pantograph mechanism in their design, because this was an easy way to lift the contact strips vertically. Because of that mechanism that was used in the past we started to call the devices on top of the train pantographs. For current day systems the term pantograph is actually a misnomer as the actual pantograph mechanism is not present anymore.

##### 3rd Rail system

Instead of using a resilient overhead line it is also possible to collect energy from the rails, which requires a third rail. Because third rail systems present electric shock hazards close to the ground, high voltages (above 1500 V) are not considered safe. A very high current must therefore be used to transfer adequate power, resulting in high resistive losses, and requiring relatively closely spaced feed points (electrical substations). For these reasons this systems is only used for low-speed, light-rail, systems. The electrified rail threatens electrocution of anyone wandering or falling onto the tracks. This can be avoided by using platform screen doors, or the risk can be reduced by placing the conductor rail on the side of the track away from the platform, when allowed by the station layout. The end ramps of conductor rails (where they are interrupted, or change sides) present a practical limitation on speed due to the mechanical impact of the shoe, and 160 km/h (100 mph) is considered the upper limit of practical third-rail operation.

One might think why a third rail is required to do so as we need two polarities, which only two rails can cover. The first idea for feeding electricity to a train from an external source was by using both rails on which a train runs, whereby each rail is a conductor for each polarity, and is insulated by the sleepers. This method is used by most scale model trains, however it does not work so well for large trains as the sleepers are not good insulators. Furthermore, the electric connection requires insulated wheels or insulated axles, but most insulation materials have poor mechanical properties compared with metals used for this purpose, leading to a less stable train vehicle. Nevertheless, it was sometimes used at the beginning of the development of electric trains.

#### Pantograph and Catenary Interaction

---

#### From Power to Traction

Traction is the actual force that a train utilizes to push itself forward on the track. To understand traction you should compare a train to yourself running. What do you need to do to get yourself forward if you want to run? You have to exert force with your feet onto the street. That's exactly what a train is doing: its wheels exert traction force to the track.

The amount of motive power available determines the amount of traction available. A heavy train requires more traction to move compared to a light rail vehicle. Therefore a heavy rail locomotive disposes more power than a light rail vehicle. But there is more to it. For example, the maximal velocity that a train can attain is also governed by the available power.

This is understood by the traction curve. The traction curve is a graph that shows the available traction at each velocity. The graph below shows such a curve. Now picture yourself running again, if you run in a crosswind or uphill, you need more motive power. This extra amount of force is known as the resistance force. The same is true for a train. It turns out that this resistive force also depends on the trains velocity. Therefore, also a curve showing the resistive force is shown. If traction force equals resistive forces, the maximal velocity of the train is attained.

Please use the sliders in the graph below to explore the effect of different parameters on the curves. P is the motive power available for the train. S is the frontal surface area of the train and grade is the slope of the track.

#### Rail Lab [1]

We welcome you to the TU Delft Rail Lab. This is where we can test and innovate on a 1 to 1 scale and is where the research and computer simulations come to life.

One of the projects currently in development is our rolling pantograph, which is mounted onto our catenary simulator. The simulator enables us to test the interaction with existing and new pantographs to improve the point of contact. We can upload any part of the Dutch electrified network onto the system, after which, it is exactly simulated, giving us extremely detailed insights. The rolling design is created to limit wear of both the wire as well as the pantograph itself. Where a large part of the railway infrastructure is equipped with a catenary system, the pantograph has had a similar design since the very beginning. This test equipment is used by our research team and technical staff to design new models, creating a essential step towards proven technology before using it on actual trains.

#### Contact patch


The surface of contact between wheel and rail is no more than the size of a Eurocent, whereas the actual diameter of the train wheel is normally around 900 mm. As small as it might be, it is the essential contact part to get into movement.

Understanding what happens in this small contact area is important for comfort, wear and safety. 

The contact patch is small but the weight of a full train is on that two square cm area. This means a lot of forces are involved on both the wheel as well as the rail. In the next item we will look at the forces that the rails has to deal with to get the train into movement. To learn all about the dynamics behind the contact point between wheel and rail we have to go much more into depth. This will be discussed the more detailed during the Online Professional Education Courses.

At Delft University of Technology we do many tests to understand and improve wheel/rail interface. It is rather unusual to use the same material when we talk about friction. If we look at cars the rubber tires will give up much sooner than the asphalt road surface and within the engine we use lubricant if steel and steel come together to prevent wear. In case of trains we directly put steel on steel, which makes wear inescapable, but unpredictable. 

Our own rolling laboratorium measures the track in The Netherlands to test, learn and innovate together with the sector in which both our Bachelor and Master students participate.

More on this topic in week 5: Monitoring and Maintenance.

#### Rolling resistance

From the traction force comes the maximum velocity, when this traction force is equal to all resistive forces. One well-known resistive force is the air resistance, another is the rolling resistance. The value of this rolling resistance depends on multiple things, like the use of bearings and the material of the wheels and the surface they’re riding on. The latter is interesting to look at for trains.

We have seen the importance of the small contact area, which causes heavy forces while driving, but to get the train out of its stationary position the track has to suffer a great deal, which is visualised in the animation below. 


It takes over 20 seconds before the wheels actually get into motion. While pressure is building up, the contact patch becomes clearly visible. Significant energy is needed to get the full combination rolling, which sometimes can result in wheel slip, when the weight is too much for the locomotive(s) to pull smoothly.

#### Truck vs. Train

Trucks drive on a road made of asphalt or concrete and have rubber tires, which makes a great difference on multiple scales compared to trains. Looking at the properties of the materials, we know that rubber will give in first, which we can anticipate. In case of trains, this is more complex, since both train and wheel are made from steel. This makes wear difficult to predict (more on this in week 5), but it limits rolling resistance.

On roads, tires deform due to the weight of the truck, which increases resistance in rolling direction, in addition to the standard friction between rubber and asphalt. We previously saw that the contact patch of track and train is no more than the size of a penny, the contact area of a tire and the road is closer to the size of a dinner plate.

The less a wheel or tire deforms, the lower the rolling resistance will be. As trains have steel wheels, which will not deform as much, the rolling resistance that trains experience is very low, enabling them to carry much heavier loads.

As an example, imagine a load of 25 metric tonnes. A lorry will need quite a large engine of around 500 horsepower or 367 kW to transport this. Whereas, a train with 5000 kW of power will easily move 1800 metric tonnes. The power needed to transport a metric tonne with a train is almost 5 times lower! 

The reason why trains initially move so slowly has to do with rolling resistance, but this is directly related to the enormous weight of both the train and load. This combination also influences the braking distance, which is significantly longer for trains than for other vehicles.

#### Weight, Speed and Curves

What does a guitar string have to do with a rails?
How is corrugated cardboard similar to a light rail track?
What is the similarity between a cone and a train wheel?

To explain some of the basics related to the complex forces that are at play in railways, we will use familiar shapes and items. Weight and speed are essential elements when defining a type of vehicle and its properties. 

##### Curves

Tram and metro networks follow the city streets, which requires rather sharp turns within an existing urban grid. To be able to make these curves both their driving speed and axle load are lower than those of regular trains and the carriages are shorter. Canting tracks (think of a race curve) are used to limit the angle of attack of a train running through a curve and to make sure that trains don't derail. For trams, this is rather unusual because their tracks intervene continuously with our road network, so they have to stay levelled. This also is the reason why it is impossible to add a switch within a canting track, since trains use two tracks which have to be on one level as well.

Why do you sometimes experience a ‘swinging motion’ when travelling on a train? Even on perfectly straight parts of the track? To understand where this ‘hunting’ comes from, we need to understand how a train goes through a curve first.


In modern bogies, wheelset are mounted with suspension. This suspension dampens the ‘hunting’ behaviour of the train avoiding an unpleasant journey.

##### 'Steady wave'

For comfortable train travel and to limit wear we prefer a straight track. To maintain this over time is highly expensive, which is why the rail slowly transforms in a wavy surface (mainly at light rail). The visualisation below shows an extreme enlargement of this effect, looking a little like corrugated cardboard. When a train passes by with slow speed, it will follow the wavy structure, but when the same train passes driving much faster it will only make contact with the top of the waves. This results in extreme wear worsening the track status.



##### 'Moving wave'

The track that you see at the station continues for thousands of kilometers, sometimes crossing multiple countries. All the separate track sections are welded together to create one long set of rails. If a train passes over it, the rails vibrate due to the load. This can be compared to a guitar string, which, when in motion, gives a continuous vibration that results in a wave traveling along the string. In rails, this vibration can be much stronger than the train passing over it, making the train come loose from the track. When heavy rail infrastructure (thick rail) is used for light rail vehicles, this worsens due to the relatively light train. It can be compared to a fly trying to walk over the earlier mentioned guitar string. While rails do not seem to vibrate that easily, the video below shows how much a guitar string vibrates than you might have expected. Focus on how the thicker strings move more extreme than the thinner ones, which is comparable to thick versus thin rails.


After getting more detailed insights on track, train and their interaction, are you able to answer the following question?

When comparing light and heavy rail, on which would you expect more wear and in which more cracks?


---

#### Switches

Switches and crossings are essential parts of the railway network. More switches means more flexibility of the network, but at the same time more switches also increases the change of one breaking down and disturbance of the railway network. Issues related to weight and speed in curves, have even more effect in switches. 

In the short video below Network Rail explains very clearly how a switch works, how the train is guided to either one direction or the other and the large impact on the crossing nose. We highlighted 50 seconds of animated material, but feel free to watch the full video on YouTube.


A standard turn­out, as shown in Figure A, allows movement of traffic in a straight direction on the through track or in a divergent direction. A symmetrical turnout (Figure B) is a special case of a turnout with 2 routes diverging symmetrically from the common route. A diamond crossing with a sin­gle slip is a crossing which only has one connection between intersecting routes (Figure D) and because of this has 3 routing possibilities. A diamond crossing with double slips consists of two diagonally intersecting tracks which are connected by two curves (Figure E and the middle image below). This means that there are 4 routing possibili­ties. Connection between two parallel tracks con­sisting of two single turnouts (shown the left image below) is commonly used by trains to change a track when the other one is closed for e.g. repair. A crossover with two turnouts and two double slips with central diamond crossing shown in Figure H and the right image below, is typically used at train stations and train yards.

Turnouts differ in sizes. Some commonly used ones are shown below. The number after '1:' stands for the angle of intersection. The length and the maximum allowable speed to pass the turnout in the divergent direction are given below as well. 

1:9 - 32 meter - 40km/h
1:12 - 38 meter - 60 km/h
1:15 - 47 meter - 80 km/h
1:34 - 99 meter - 140 km/h

To travel fast through a switch, the length of the switch should be increased and with increase of the length the construction costs and maintenance increase as well. A dilemma which will come back multiple times during this MOOC and in every situation, that has to be balanced to meet the demands of the different stakeholders.

#### Rail Lab [2]

Within the Rail Lab of Delft University of Technology we have a Wheel/rail test rig that can simulate speeds up to 240km/h. Where the scale is 1:7, all forces are balanced to this scale as well. Both track and wheels are made from actual used train wheels and rails. One week on the test track is comparable to one year on the railway network, so it is a great way to speed up new possible innovations and test results.

In week 5 of this MOOC we will show you the test rig in action.

#### Introduction

This is the first week that you are asked to interact with our world map. This is a great place to learn from each other and thus learn about other countries. 

If you need assistance with using the WorldMap, you can either go to our manual or ask on the forum.

Your challenge this week is to give more information about the size, structure and history of the railway network in your country or a specific country of your choosing. This includes some basic research on the key figures for your country's network.

Step 1: create a new account

Step 2: go to the Assignment Tab to find Week 1's assignments

Step 3: complete the Week 1 assignments with some short research

A note about this assignment:
NB. This is a graded weekly assignment, and each week contains multiple questions which require some research. However, this should be a fun, crowdsourcing activity, and should not take more than 20 minutes of research to answer a whole section! You are welcome to put a lot more time an effort in, but it is not expected of you.

 We understand that not all countries will have easily accessible data, so if you are really unable to answer a question after browsing - please don't leave the course. Just click "Completed" below, if you have answered all the questions to the best of your ability in the time frame.

In addition, crowdsourcing from multiple references may mean that we get slightly different results depending on the year sourced (for instance: different Wikipedia articles say the Netherlands has "397 stations", "404 stations" and "around 400 stations". While the latest data from our railway company confirms it is 404 station, "around 400" is sufficient. Moreover, our world map will reflect the average response for each country). We do strongly encourage you to reference sources younger than 2010, where possible.
