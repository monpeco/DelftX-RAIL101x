#### Week 1: Introduction

#### Introducing Track, Train and Movement

This week, we get moving, by introducing different train types and tracks and have a close look at the small contact areas where both come together: wheel/rail interface and pantograph/catenary interaction.

While waiting on a station's platform, you might see different types of trains passing by: regular passenger trains, freight trains with sometimes strange looking wagons, high speed trains and, when connected to a light rail network, tram, metro or even mono-rail.

Where some train-types can share the same track, there are different ways to set-up this infrastructure to meet specific demands. Parts of this week's content might already seem familiar, but we will take these first few hours to ease into the topic, which builds up over the coming weeks. 

In terms of assignments, you can expect two short quizzes and an interactive world map (crowdsourcing) assignment. 

##### Are you an expert in the field?

That's great! This MOOC introduces different aspects of the railway network, but if you want to go into more detail, you may be interested in our follow-up online professional education courses (Operations Course starting in September 2018).

The first course will be fully dedicated to the topic of Track, Train and Motion, but at a greater depth, with a strong focus on the professional working environment. You might cruise through this MOOC rather easily, but consider it as a way to get familiar with online learning. There are numerous (fun) facts and international examples to explore, and at least a few will be new to you. Moreover, this is an opportunity to meet other experts from all around the world.

Are you interested in finding more information about our online Professional Education Rail courses or are you looking for ways to gain new knowledge and expertise for your daily work? Then, we invite you to join us in the advanced series! Follow this [link](https://online-learning.tudelft.nl/courses/professional-certificate-program-in-railway-engineering/).

This MOOC is the first in a series of five, consisting of three additional follow-up courses and a capstone project. But, if you cannot wait, at the end of this week there are a few expert [articles](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DelftX+RAIL101x+3T2018/courseware/49f70ce89c154f00bc0ba3a2a5a9ac4b/c710bcaf36b0424e9105cc76a1e3907f/1?activate_block_id=block-v1%3ADelftX%2BRAIL101x%2B3T2018%2Btype%40vertical%2Bblock%406876bd32584c47b8a39b9adb3da77681) by our academic staff to get you started.

#### A Tangible Railway Network

You are probably familiar with a specific railway network. At least, we are pretty sure that you are familiar with trains and track. Nevertheless, we think that it's advantageous to align our understanding of the railways. Therefore we start this module with an overview of the main parts of railway networks.

- **track**: In traditional designs the rails of the track are supported by wooden or concrete beams,
called **sleepers**, which in turn rest on the ballast bed
- **ballast bed**: crushed stone where the rail rest.

*There are also track structures without ballast. The most typical one is a slab track, where the ballast bed is replaced by a concrete plate or slab.*

- Traditionally rails are joined using metal **fishplates** and have a small gap between the rails.
The gap gives the rails a possibility for expansion during hot weather.
The gaps also introduce rail discontinuity, which is one of the main sources of track damage.
Therefore, in modern tracks, the rails are continuously welded,
which eliminates the gap and the rail discontinuity.

- In a railway vehicle the car body is supported by two **bogies**.
- Each bogie has two wheelsets which are rigidly connected to an axle. All these elements are connected to each other by suspensions.

- Other familiar components of the railway network are **stations and yards**.
- Trains carry passengers from station to station where they can transfer to other means of transportation.
- **Yards** are arrangements of sidings used to store trains.

- Signals are a common system for controlling train movements. In general, they indicate whether a train may enter the section of track beyond the signal.

- **Turnouts**, also called **switches**, are the components of a railway network that guide trains from one track to another.

- The main parts of a turnout are the **switch panel** and the **crossing panel**.

- In the switching part a pair of movable rails called **blades**, or points, can be shifted, which provides the switching possibilities.

- In the crossing panel the two tracks intersect at one level. The rails are disconnected in the intersection point, enabling the wheel of the train to pass the two crossed rails. To bridge this gap, wing rails are mounted on each side of the intersecting portion of the two running rails.

- **Level crossings** are intersections where a railway line crosses a road or path at the same level. In order to provide "passive" protection, various types of warning signs can be placed in front of the crossing. The use of automatic warning devices such as flashing lights, warning tones and boom gates are called "active" protection.

- Railway lines may also cross over or under roads and rivers using bridges, aqueducts or tunnels. the rails are usually directly fastened to the bridge deck. Guard rails are placed along areas of restricted clearance. These rails keep the wheels of the train in alignment in case of derailment. This way damage to the struture is minimized.
