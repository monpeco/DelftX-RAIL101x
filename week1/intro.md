#### Track, Train and Movement

An infrastructural network connecting you with the rest of the world. To keep this all running, we first have to get it in motion. For this, we need a track, train and power source.

Thus in week 1, we introduce different train types (from light-rail to high-speed) and tracks and have a close look at the small contact areas where both come together: wheel/rail interface and pantograph/catenary interaction.

#### People and the Railway Network

Railways connect us on a local, national and international scale and, like airplanes, while they may cover a large part of your journey, they rarely take you directly to your final destination.

In week 2, we will take a closer look at the different forms of transport connecting the railway network to transport that takes you from door-to-door. We will discuss the design and structure of railway stations, the people flow within and around them, and the value of a large station to the city on a social, demographical, economical and architectural level.  We will also look at examples of how railways influence the urban scale and sometimes even form barriers dividing a city. Trains can also cause nuisances for the surrounding areas by means of noise and vibration. This and other aspects will be explained to get a better sense of the positive and negative effects of train travelling. 

During this week, we also introduce our interactive railway game for you to experience some of these challenges for yourself.

#### Real Time Traffic Control

If your train was the only one, life would be so much simpler. It could leave at the desired time and take you directly to your preferred destination. There would only have to be one track, one platform, no switches and (most likely) no delay. But, when millions start using the railway network, it becomes rather complex. Passengers expect to be able to travel at any time to any place, and unfortunately, both trains and the infrastructure have limited capacity.

We have local trains, interstate trains, high-speed trains and freight trains, which are all connected somehow. Strategic and robust timetabling is essential to ensure comfort, reliability and safety. If something unforeseen happens, people have to be able to adjust at the moment, keeping the inconvenience to a minimum. The challenge is not to make the perfect timetable on paper, but the one that is adaptable to the unexpected challenges that can happen at any moment.
