#### Track, Train and Movement

An infrastructural network connecting you with the rest of the world. To keep this all running, we first have to get it in motion. For this, we need a track, train and power source.

Thus in week 1, we introduce different train types (from light-rail to high-speed) and tracks and have a close look at the small contact areas where both come together: wheel/rail interface and pantograph/catenary interaction.

#### People and the Railway Network

Railways connect us on a local, national and international scale and, like airplanes, while they may cover a large part of your journey, they rarely take you directly to your final destination.

In week 2, we will take a closer look at the different forms of transport connecting the railway network to transport that takes you from door-to-door. We will discuss the design and structure of railway stations, the people flow within and around them, and the value of a large station to the city on a social, demographical, economical and architectural level.  We will also look at examples of how railways influence the urban scale and sometimes even form barriers dividing a city. Trains can also cause nuisances for the surrounding areas by means of noise and vibration. This and other aspects will be explained to get a better sense of the positive and negative effects of train travelling. 

During this week, we also introduce our interactive railway game for you to experience some of these challenges for yourself.

#### Real Time Traffic Control

If your train was the only one, life would be so much simpler. It could leave at the desired time and take you directly to your preferred destination. There would only have to be one track, one platform, no switches and (most likely) no delay. But, when millions start using the railway network, it becomes rather complex. Passengers expect to be able to travel at any time to any place, and unfortunately, both trains and the infrastructure have limited capacity.

We have local trains, interstate trains, high-speed trains and freight trains, which are all connected somehow. Strategic and robust timetabling is essential to ensure comfort, reliability and safety. If something unforeseen happens, people have to be able to adjust at the moment, keeping the inconvenience to a minimum. The challenge is not to make the perfect timetable on paper, but the one that is adaptable to the unexpected challenges that can happen at any moment.

#### Complexity of Disruptions

The appearance of any undesired event is perceived as a disruption in the railway system. Extreme weather circumstances, failing technology (like a broken switch) or human interference (like someone walking on the track or a train driver who overslept) they all can be the reason for a delay. There is a wide range of causes, which all have different effects on the system.

During week 4, we will have a look at the most common causes and some of the more rare ones, and we will analyse how to deal with them. To prevent or reduce the number of disruptions, preventive maintenance and strategies are planned by the railway operator and other parties involved. Nonetheless, even with preventive measures, some disruptions will occur due to external factors. Once a disruption has occurred, it must be resolved. The resolution of the issue should come after evaluating its cause and effect, the significance of the overall operation of the system, or whether it poses a risk in any way.

#### Monitoring and Maintenance

In Week 5, we examine a variety of monitoring and maintenance strategies and techniques, including Structural Health Monitoring (SHM).

There is a large step to go from a measurement technique to a monitoring system. Designing a monitoring system comes with many challenges, and will be different for every case, depending on the system to be monitored, the environment and the required information. The crucial step in monitoring is the interpretation of data. In the ideal case, a monitoring system allows you to determine whether a system is damaged, where the damage is located, what type of damage is present, the extent of the damage and the expected remaining lifespan. In this week, we will examine all of these factors.

In addition, we ask you to consider the hazards and legal implications of failing to do so, by examining a few notable cases like the Hatfield Train Disaster.

#### Special and Future Systems

After analysing the railway challenges of today and developments of tomorrow, we will take a peek into future further away and some non-conventual tracks used around the world. Where the principle of trains has been similar for over 200 years, a valid question would be: will it stay this way?

That is what we will be exploring in our final week.

#### Learning Objectives

We hope you will enjoy taking this journey on railway engineering with us during the next 6 weeks. Through the use of tools like the game and the worldmap, we hope you will find this an active, interactive and enjoyable learning experience, in which you'll:

Week 1| Name the main railway network components; understand the function of each and the pantograph/catenary interaction between track and train; and compare the density and history of the rail networks around the world.
Week 2| Understand the influence that railways exert on their environment and vice versa; apply your knowledge of demand to build and operate a rail network in the game; evaluate the role of a single station using a real-world case; and examine international examples of the value of stations for the user-experience.
Week 3| Understand the different ways of train control and their effect on timetabling and safety; apply your knowledge of real-time traffic management to handle events in the game; apply the principles of adaptive timetabling to handle a real-world case.
Week 4| Examine the effects and the internal and external factors of disturbances on railway operations, evaluate cases and propose possible preventions and resolutions.
Week 5| Evaluate the different methods of dealing with system degradation and the effects of interaction between the components; apply your understanding of monitoring and maintenance in both a real-world case study and in the game this week.
Week 6| Examine state of the art and future developments of railway systems.

#### Grading

In order to pass this course, you need a final grade of 60%.

Grading is built up over the different weeks and is based on five main activities.

Quiz Questions based on text, video, partial example or animation [4%]
Forum Discussion to compare international situations and share insights [4%]
Case Study based on a realistic situation with complex challenges [6-10%]
World Map to add information and imagery of your national railway network [2%]
Rail Game in which newly gained knowledge can be brought into practice [5%]

Each activity will be graded individually and has a linked percentage which sums up to a total of 100%.
Below you will find a detailed overview per week and how the activities relate to each other during this course.

Deadlines:

While we strongly encourage you to complete all the assignments for each week within the week that they have been posted, we are aware that many of our participants have busy schedules. Thus to give you the greatest flexibility possible, the final course deadlines are all: 28 November 2018. 

The only exceptions are:

Week 3 Case Study Assignment
Submission deadline: 7 November 2018, 12noon UTC
Peer review deadline: 12 November 2018, 12noon UTC
Week 5 Case Study Assignment
Submission deadline: 21 November 2018, 12noon UTC
Peer review deadline: 26 November 2018, 12noon UTC
Want to get the most from this course?  A Verified Certificate might help.
We want you to get the most benefit possible from this course.  First and foremost, that means we want to support you in continuing to make progress in the course.  Did you know that research shows that people are more likely to complete MOOCs if they pay for the Verified Certificate (it’s a human thing – we are more likely to value things we have paid for).  So, if you want to give yourself a mental “nudge” to finish this course, consider upgrading to the verified certificate.
